professional_accounting,"Adam Smith is considering automating his pin factory with the purchase of a $475,000 machine. Shipping and installation would cost $5,000. Smith has calculated that automation would result in savings of $45,000 a year due to reduced scrap and $65,000 a year due to reduced labor costs. The machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls in the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes. The estimated final salvage value of the machine is $120,000. The firm's marginal tax rate is 34 percent. The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to The options are: A) $280,000.00, B) $380,000.00, C) $480,000.00, D) $580,000.00",C,"C) $480,000.00",True,
professional_accounting,"Which of the following items is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation? The options are: A) Discontinued operations, B) Income from continuing operations., C) Extraordinary gains and losses, D) Operating income.",D,B,False,"Step 1: Understand what intraperiod tax allocation involves. Intraperiod tax allocation is an accounting method used to allocate income taxes within a single fiscal period among different items that appear on the income statement. This method ensures that each item reflects its own tax effects, making the financial statements more accurate and meaningful.
Step 2: Identify the items typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. Generally, intraperiod tax allocation is applied to items that are unusual or infrequent, such as discontinued operations and extraordinary items. This is because these items can significantly affect the tax expense reported on the income statement, and allocating taxes to these items separately helps in presenting a clearer picture of the company's financial performance.
Step 3: Evaluate the options given in the question. A) Discontinued operations are typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they represent a significant event that is separate from the company's ongoing operations. B) Income from continuing operations is the baseline for calculating income taxes and is not 'allocated' taxes in the same way as specific, unusual, or infrequent items. C) Extraordinary gains and losses, under the guidelines that used to define them, were subject to intraperiod tax allocation due to their unusual nature and infrequency. However, it's worth noting that the accounting standards have evolved, and the concept of 'extraordinary items' has been eliminated under U.S. GAAP, but the principle of allocating taxes to significant, unusual, or infrequent items remains. D) Operating income is part of income from continuing operations and does not get separately allocated income taxes for intraperiod purposes.
Step 4: Based on the analysis, the item that is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation is the income from continuing operations, as it represents the baseline activity of the company and does not get separately allocated income taxes in the context of intraperiod tax allocation."

professional_accounting,"Johnson worked for ABC Co. and earned a salary of $100,000. Johnson also received, as a fringe benefit, group termlife insurance at twice Johnson’s salary. The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. What amount must Johnson include in gross income? The options are: A) $100,000, B) $100,276, C) $100,414, D) $100,552",C,C,False,"step 1: Identify the total amount of group term life insurance provided to Johnson, which is twice his salary. So, 2 * $100,000 = $200,000.
step 2: Calculate the cost of this insurance per $1,000 of coverage. The IRS established uniform cost is $2.76 per $1,000.
step 3: Determine how many thousands of dollars worth of insurance Johnson has. $200,000 / $1,000 = 200.
step 4: Multiply the number of thousands of dollars worth of insurance by the cost per $1,000 to find the total cost of the insurance. 200 * $2.76 = $552.
step 5: Since the first $50,000 of employer-provided group term life insurance is excluded from gross income under IRS rules, only the cost of insurance over this amount is taxable. Johnson has $200,000 of coverage, so $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000 is the amount over the exclusion.
step 6: Calculate the taxable cost of the insurance over the exclusion. Since we already calculated the total cost of the insurance for $200,000 of coverage to be $552, we need to calculate the cost for the first $50,000 and subtract it from $552 to find the taxable amount. The cost for $50,000 of coverage is ($50,000 / $1,000) * $2.76 = 50 * $2.76 = $138.
step 7: Subtract the non-taxable cost ($138) from the total cost ($552) to find the taxable benefit. $552 - $138 = $414.
step 8: Add the taxable benefit to Johnson's salary to find the total amount that must be included in gross income. $100,000 + $414 = $100,414."

Step 2: Identify the costs directly related to the construction of the new building. This includes the new building construction cost of $1,850,000.
Step 3: Determine if the cost of razing the old building ($60,000) should be included. Since it is necessary to clear the site for the new building, this cost is directly attributable to the construction process and should be included.
Step 4: Evaluate whether the title insurance and legal fees to purchase land ($30,000) should be included. These costs are related to the acquisition of the land, not the construction of the building, and should not be included in the cost of the building.
Step 5: Consider if the architect's fees ($95,000) should be included. Since these fees are directly related to the design and construction of the new building, they should be included in the building's cost.
Step 6: Add the costs identified in steps 2, 3, and 5 to calculate the total cost to be capitalized for the completed factory building. This is $1,850,000 (construction cost) + $60,000 (razing cost) + $95,000 (architect's fees) = $2,005,000.
Step 7: Compare the calculated total cost with the provided options to identify the correct answer."

professional_accounting,"Spark Co. buys cordless phones for $125 each and sells them for $200 each. Spark pays a sales commission of $25 per phone sold and monthly fixed costs are $3000. Assuming Spark desired a profit of 10% of sales how many units must Spark sell? The options are: A) 600, B) 400, C) 200, D) 100",D,D,False,"Step 1: Calculate the profit per unit by subtracting the cost per unit and the sales commission from the selling price. Profit per unit = $200 (selling price) - $125 (cost per unit) - $25 (sales commission) = $50.
Step 2: Calculate the desired total profit by applying the desired profit percentage to the total sales. Desired profit = 10% of sales. However, we need to calculate the number of units first to determine total sales, so we'll incorporate this in a later step.
Step 3: Set up the equation to solve for the number of units (N) needed to meet the desired profit, incorporating fixed costs, profit per unit, and desired profit percentage. The equation is: Total Sales = N * $200 (selling price per unit), Desired Profit = 10% of Total Sales, and Total Profit = (Profit per unit * N) + Fixed Costs.
Step 4: Realize that the step 3 equation needs correction because the desired profit is not added to fixed costs but is a part of the total profit calculation. Correct equation: Total Profit = (Profit per unit * N) - Fixed Costs, and we aim for this total profit to be 10% of Total Sales.
Step 5: Since we know the desired profit is 10% of Total Sales, we can express Total Sales as Total Sales = N * $200. Therefore, Desired Profit = 0.10 * (N * $200).
Step 6: Substitute the expression for Desired Profit into the Total Profit equation and solve for N. We get: 0.10 * (N * $200) = ($50 * N) - $3000.
Step 7: Simplify the equation: $20N = $50N - $3000.
Step 8: Rearrange the equation to solve for N: $30N = $3000.
Step 9: Solve for N: N = $3000 / $30 = 100."

The options are: A) 10%, B) 5%, C) 3.40%, D) 9.70%",A,None of the options match the calculated value. There seems to be a mistake in the calculation.,False,"Step 1: Understand that the standard deviation of a portfolio, especially one with two assets, can be calculated using the formula: 
σp = √[w1^2 * σ1^2 + w2^2 * σ2^2 + 2 * w1 * w2 * Cov(1,2)], where σp is the portfolio standard deviation, w1 and w2 are the weights of the assets in the portfolio, σ1 and σ2 are the standard deviations of the assets, and Cov(1,2) is the covariance between the two assets.
Step 2: Given that the portfolio is equally weighted, w1 = w2 = 0.5.
Step 3: Given that the standard deviations of Stocks A and B are 6% (or 0.06) and 18% (or 0.18) respectively.
Step 4: The correlation coefficient between the two stocks is given as 0.2. The covariance between two assets can be calculated using the formula: Cov(1,2) = Corr(1,2) * σ1 * σ2, where Corr(1,2) is the correlation coefficient between the two assets.
Step 5: Calculate the covariance between Stocks A and B: Cov(A,B) = 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18.
Step 6: Substitute the values into the portfolio standard deviation formula: σp = √[0.5^2 * 0.06^2 + 0.5^2 * 0.18^2 + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * (0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18)].
Step 7: Perform the calculations: σp = √[0.5^2 * 0.06^2 + 0.5^2 * 0.18^2 + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * (0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18)] = √[0.0018 + 0.0162 + 0.00108] = √[0.01908].
Step 8: Calculate the square root of 0.01908 to find the portfolio's standard deviation.
Step 9: σp = √[0.01908] = 0.1381 or 13.81%."

The options are: A) $4,000 loss., B) No gain or loss., C) $6,000 gain., D) $36,000 gain.",B,B,False,"step 1: Identify the basis for the child. Since the stock was a gift, the basis for the child is the same as the donor's basis, which is $40,000.
step 2: Determine the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift. The FMV is $30,000.
step 3: Identify the selling price of the stock, which is $36,000.
step 4: Determine if the sale results in a gain or loss. Since the selling price ($36,000) is less than the basis ($40,000), this would typically indicate a loss. However, for gifted property, special rules apply.
step 5: For determining gain, use the donor's basis ($40,000). Since the selling price ($36,000) is less than the donor's basis, but more than the FMV at the time of the gift, the difference between the selling price and the donor's basis is a loss. However, this loss is not recognized because it falls within the range of the FMV at the time of the gift and the donor's basis.
step 6: For determining loss, if the selling price had been below the FMV at the time of the gift ($30,000), then the basis for loss would be the FMV at the time of the gift. Since the selling price ($36,000) is above the FMV, no loss is recognized.
step 7: Since the selling price is between the donor's basis and the FMV at the time of the gift, and the rules for recognizing gain or loss on gifted property prevent recognizing a loss in this scenario, the child does not recognize any gain or loss."
professional_accounting,"A shoe retailer allows customers to return shoes within 90 days of purchase. The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned within the 90-day period.

The options are: A) $185,000, B) $190,000, C) $195,000, D) $200,000",B,B,False,"Step 1: Understand the problem. The company needs to account for estimated returns within the 90-day return period for sales made during the current month. This means we need to calculate the estimated returns for the current month's sales and subtract that from the total sales to get the net sales revenue for new sales.
Step 2: Calculate the estimated returns for the current month's sales. The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned. So, we calculate 5% of $200,000, which is the total sales for the month.
Step 3: Perform the calculation for the estimated returns. 5% of $200,000 = 0.05 * $200,000 = $10,000.
Step 4: Calculate the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month by subtracting the estimated returns from the total sales. Net sales revenue = Total sales - Estimated returns = $200,000 - $10,000.
Step 5: Perform the calculation for the net sales revenue. Net sales revenue = $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000."

Step 3: Examine the $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance but was returned by the bank on December 30 stamped 'NSF' (Non-Sufficient Funds). Since this check was included in the balance but then bounced, it means the actual cash balance was overstated by $1,000.
Step 4: Subtract the $1,000 from the initial balance to adjust for the NSF check. This is because the NSF check was included in the balance, but since it bounced, the actual cash available is less by that amount.
Step 5: Calculate the adjusted cash balance by subtracting $1,000 from the initial $10,000 balance, which gives us $9,000.

Long, a purchasing agent for Frost, placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf after Frost was declared incompetent. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.
Step 2: Recognize the legal principle that an agent's authority typically ends when the principal (in this case, Frost) becomes incompetent, unless there are specific provisions or types of agency that survive such changes.
Step 3: Consider the options provided. Option A suggests that Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence, which would generally not be the case unless there was a durable power of attorney or similar arrangement, which is not mentioned.
Step 4: Option B suggests the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence. This overlooks the fact that an agent's authority to act on behalf of a principal typically ceases if the principal is declared incompetent, affecting the validity of contracts entered into after such declaration.
Step 5: Option C suggests that Frost or Frost's legal representative would not be liable because Grant dealt only with Long. This option ignores the principle that an agent's actions within their authority bind the principal.
Step 6: Option D suggests that Long did not have authority to enter into the contract due to Frost's incompetence. This aligns with the general principle that an agent's authority ends when the principal is declared incompetent, unless there are specific arrangements to the contrary.
Step 7: Conclude that the most legally sound option, based on general principles of agency law, is that Frost or Frost's legal representative would not be liable because Long's authority to act on behalf of Frost likely ended with Frost's declaration of incompetence, making Option D the most appropriate choice."

The options are: A) 0%, B) 8%, C) 16%, D) -4%",B,B,False,"step 1: Recall the formula for the price of a stock based on the dividend discount model for a growing perpetuity, which is P = D0 * (1 + g) / (r - g), where P is the price of the stock, D0 is the last dividend paid, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the expected return on equity.
step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula: $75 = $3 * (1 + g) / (0.12 - g).
step 3: Simplify the equation to solve for g. First, multiply both sides by (0.12 - g) to get rid of the denominator: $75 * (0.12 - g) = $3 * (1 + g).
step 4: Expand both sides of the equation: $9 - $75g = $3 + $3g.
step 5: Bring all terms involving g to one side and constant terms to the other side: $9 - $3 = $75g + $3g.

The options are: A) January., B) March., C) May., D) July.",A,C,False,"Step 1: Understand the nature of the lease. The company enters into an operating lease, which means the lease payments are generally recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, starting when the lessee gains control or use of the leased asset.

The expected payback period for the new machine is 5.2 years. What amount did the company pay for the new machine? The options are: A) $145,600, B) $161,200, C) $166,400, D) $182,000",C,C,False,"Step 1: Understand the concept of payback period. The payback period is the time it takes for an investment to generate an amount of income or cash equal to the cost of the investment. 
Step 2: Calculate the net annual cash inflow from the machine. This is done by subtracting the annual operating expenses from the annual revenues. Annual revenues are $35,000 and annual operating expenses are $7,000, so net annual cash inflow = $35,000 - $7,000 = $28,000. 
Step 3: Note that depreciation is a non-cash expense and has already been included in the operating expenses. However, for the purpose of calculating cash flows for the payback period, we need to add back the depreciation expense to the net annual cash inflow since it does not reduce the actual cash flow. So, adjusted net annual cash inflow = $28,000 + $4,000 = $32,000. 
Step 4: Use the payback period formula to find the initial investment. The formula is: Initial Investment = Net Annual Cash Inflow x Payback Period. Here, the payback period is 5.2 years, so Initial Investment = $32,000 x 5.2. 
Step 5: Calculate the initial investment by multiplying the adjusted net annual cash inflow by the payback period. Initial Investment = $32,000 x 5.2 = $166,400."

The options are: A) Discontinued operations, B) Income from continuing operations., C) Extraordinary gains and losses, D) Operating income.",D,D,False,"Step 1: Understand what intraperiod income tax allocation is. Intraperiod income tax allocation involves allocating income taxes within a single fiscal period among different components of net income and other comprehensive income. This is done to show the tax effect of each component separately, providing a clearer picture of a company's financial performance.
Step 2: Identify the components typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. These components usually include items that are unusual or infrequent, such as discontinued operations and extraordinary items, because showing their tax effects separately helps users of financial statements understand their impact on the overall tax expense.
Step 3: Analyze each option in the context of intraperiod tax allocation. A) Discontinued operations are typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they are significant, infrequent, or unusual events. B) Income from continuing operations is the baseline for calculating income taxes but is not separately allocated for tax purposes within the period; rather, it's the aggregate income that tax is calculated on. C) Extraordinary gains and losses, under accounting standards that recognize them, would be subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they are unusual and infrequent. However, it's worth noting that many accounting standards, including U.S. GAAP, have moved away from categorizing items as extraordinary. D) Operating income is a component of income from continuing operations and does not get separately allocated for tax purposes within the period.

What amount is the gain, if any, that the shareholder must recognize The options are: A) $0, B) $6,000, C) $8,000, D) $12,000",B,"B) $6,000",False,"Step 1: Understand the scenario. A shareholder contributes equipment to an S corporation. The equipment has a fair market value of $20,000, a basis of $6,000, and is subject to a $12,000 liability.
Step 2: Recognize the rule for gain recognition. Generally, no gain or loss is recognized on the transfer of property to a corporation in exchange for its stock, as long as the transferor controls the corporation immediately after the exchange. However, if the property is subject to a liability that the corporation assumes, the transferor must recognize gain to the extent that the liability exceeds the basis of the transferred property.
Step 3: Calculate the difference between the liability and the basis of the equipment. The liability is $12,000, and the basis is $6,000. The difference is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.
Step 4: Determine the amount of gain to be recognized. Since the liability ($12,000) exceeds the basis of the equipment ($6,000) by $6,000, this amount represents the gain that must be recognized by the shareholder."

The options are: A) Fraudulent reporting of employees’ own hours., B) Errors in employees’ overtime computation, C) Inaccurate accounting of employees’ hours., D) Recording of other employees’ hours.",B,B,False,"Step 1: Understand the new system involves an identification number selection and a clock-in or clock-out button, with a video camera capturing the process.
Step 2: Analyze how the new system could impact fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours. The identification number and video capture make it harder for employees to falsely report their hours, as there is a direct link to their identity and visual evidence of their actions.
Step 3: Consider the impact on errors in employees' overtime computation. The new system, by accurately recording clock-in and clock-out times, could potentially reduce manual calculation errors, assuming the system automatically calculates overtime based on these accurate in/out times.
Step 4: Evaluate the effect on inaccurate accounting of employees' hours. The system's design directly addresses this issue by ensuring that clock-in and clock-out times are accurately recorded, reducing the likelihood of inaccuracies.
Step 5: Assess the impact on recording of other employees' hours. The identification number and video evidence make it difficult for one employee to clock in or out for another, thus reducing the possibility of this type of fraud.
Step 6: Determine which of the listed exposures the new system changes the least. Given the direct impact on fraudulent reporting, inaccurate accounting, and recording of other employees' hours, the system's least impact would likely be on errors in employees' overtime computation, as this is more about the calculation process rather than the accuracy of the clock-in and clock-out data itself."

The options are: A) 40.00%, B) 10.00%, C) 4.00%, D) 0.025",D,D,False,"step 1: Understand the given information. Gamma Co. has a 10% return on assets (ROA) and an asset turnover of 4:1.
step 2: Recall the formula for Return on Assets (ROA), which is ROA = Net Income / Total Assets.
step 3: Recall the formula for Asset Turnover, which is Sales / Total Assets.
step 4: Understand that the profit margin on sales is calculated as Net Income / Sales.
step 5: Realize that we can express ROA in terms of profit margin and asset turnover by combining the formulas from steps 2 and 3. This gives us ROA = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Total Assets), simplifying to ROA = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover.
step 6: Substitute the given values into the formula from step 5. We have ROA = 10% and Asset Turnover = 4. Therefore, 0.10 = Profit Margin * 4.
step 7: Solve the equation from step 6 for Profit Margin. This gives us Profit Margin = 0.10 / 4 = 0.025 or 2.5%.
step 8: Realize there's a mistake in the interpretation of the final answer. The correct interpretation should be that the profit margin is 2.5%, but this option is not provided directly. The closest match in the options is D) 0.025, which seems to be a misinterpretation of 2.5% as 0.025%.

The options are: A) Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence., B) Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence., C) No, because Grant dealt only with Long., D) No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.",D,A,False,"Step 1: Understand the scenario. Long, a purchasing agent for Frost, placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf after Frost was declared incompetent. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.
Step 2: Recognize that the principal-agent relationship is affected by the principal's (Frost's) capacity to contract. Generally, the principal's incompetence would terminate the agent's (Long's) authority to act on the principal's behalf.
Step 3: Consider the effect of Frost's incompetence on Long's express authority. Normally, express authority ends when the principal can no longer legally enter into contracts, which happens when the principal is declared incompetent.
Step 4: Evaluate the knowledge of the parties involved. Neither Long nor Grant knew of Frost's incompetence at the time of the contract. This lack of knowledge is crucial in determining the validity of the contract under agency principles.
Step 5: Apply the principle of apparent authority and estoppel. Even though Frost's incompetence would typically terminate Long's authority, the fact that this incompetence was not known to Long or Grant could mean that Long still had apparent authority to act on Frost's behalf.
Step 6: Determine the liability of Frost or Frost's legal representative based on the principles of agency law. Given that the incompetence was not known to either party at the time of the contract, and Long had express authority prior to the incompetence, the contract might still bind Frost or Frost's legal representative.
Step 7: Choose the best option based on the analysis. Option A suggests that Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence, which aligns with the principle that the contract could still be valid due to the lack of knowledge of Frost's incompetence by both parties involved."

step 2: Analyze option A: The 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is compared to the 4 in the tens place (40). The value of the 4 in the tenths place is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place, because 40 (tens place) divided by 10 equals 4 (tenths place).
