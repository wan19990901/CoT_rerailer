0,Challenging Math,Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4933828. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,-9867630,0,16,['YES'],"Step 1: The total number of eggs is 16.
Step 2: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left for baking muffins.
Step 3: Since she uses all the remaining eggs for baking muffins, she doesn't have any eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.
Step 4: Since she doesn't sell any eggs at the farmers' market, she doesn't make any money from selling eggs.","Step 6: Let's assume the number of eggs used for baking muffins is a reasonable number, say 5. This is just an assumption as the given number is incorrect. Step 7: So, the total number of eggs used by Janet every day is 3 (for breakfast) + 5 (for baking muffins) = 8. Step 8: The number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market is therefore 16 (total eggs laid) - 8 (used eggs) = 8. Step 9: Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is 8 (eggs sold) * $2 (price per egg) = $16."

A 3-digit number ranges from 100 to 999, inclusive. So, there are 999 - 100 + 1 = 900 total 3-digit numbers.
Step 2: Determine the total number of 3-digit numbers with all odd digits. The first digit (hundreds place) can be any of the 9 digits from 1 to 9 (0 is not allowed as the first digit). The second and third digits (tens and units place) can be any of the 5 odd digits from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, there are 9 * 5 * 5 = 225 total 3-digit numbers with all odd digits.
Step 3: Determine the total number of 3-digit numbers with at least one even digit. This is simply the total number of 3-digit numbers minus the total number of 3-digit numbers with all odd digits. So, there are 900 - 225 = 675 total 3-digit numbers with at least one even digit.
Step 4: Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen 3-digit number has a product of digits that is even. This is the total number of 3-digit numbers with at least one even digit divided by the total number of 3-digit numbers. So, the probability is 675 / 900 = 0.75 or 3/4.
However, none of the options match this result. Let's check our calculations again. The mistake is in the total number of 3-digit numbers. We considered numbers from 100 to 999, but the problem states that the number is chosen at random. This means that the first digit can also be 0, which we didn't consider initially.
So, let's correct our calculations:
Step 1: The total number of 3-digit numbers is 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000 (each digit can be from 0 to 9).
Step 2: The total number of 3-digit numbers with all odd digits is still 9 * 5 * 5 = 225.
Step 3: The total number of 3-digit numbers with at least one even digit is 1000 - 225 = 775.
Step 4: The probability is 775 / 1000 = 0.775 or 31/40.
Again, none of the options match this result. It seems there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided. The correct answer should be 31/40. 
However, if we consider the first digit to be from 1 to 9 (as in a standard 3-digit number), the second digit to be from 0 to 9, and the third digit to be from 0 to 9 (even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), then the calculation would be as follows:
Step 1: The total number of 3-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.
Step 2: The total number of 3-digit numbers with all odd digits is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
Step 3: The total number of 3-digit numbers with at least one even digit is 900 - 125 = 775.
Step 4: The probability is 775 / 900 = 31/36.
So, the correct answer is b) 31/36.","Step 3: Now, we need to find the probability that the product of its digits is even. For a product to be even, at least one of the factors must be even.

Step 3: Understand that if there were 60 more pounds of baking soda, the ratio of flour to baking soda would be 8:1, which means for every 8 pounds of flour, there would be 1 pound of baking soda.

Step 3: Determine which of these potential antecedents the pronoun is most likely referring to based on the context of the sentence. The sentence states that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer because 'he' focuses on code. This could imply that the developer, who is more likely to focus on code, is the one who is unable to communicate effectively. However, it could also be interpreted that the writer is the one who focuses on code, causing the communication issue.

Option (A) states that it is ambiguous, which aligns with the analysis that it could be either the developer or the writer who focuses on code. Option (B) suggests that the developer is the one who focuses on code, which is a possible interpretation.

The phrase 'because he is standing in front of the door' is providing a reason for why the mechanic is greeting the receptionist.
Step 3: Evaluate the options. Option (A) suggests that it is ambiguous who 'he' refers to. However, based on the context of the sentence, it seems clear that 'he' is referring to the person standing in front of the door, which is the reason for the mechanic's greeting.
