But when his house in Mayfield, Kentucky, went dark, all he could do was sit tight and wait. Finally he heard the roar.\\n\"My ears popped, and debris started coming through the doorway and I just dropped down on my knees, covered my head, and it was gone in 30 seconds,” the 70-year-old retired boat carpenter said of the moment one of the most powerful tornados in Kentucky history slammed into his home.\\nIn what felt like less than a minute, the facade of the house was completely gone, leaving his living room fireplace exposed and surrounded by a field of rubble.\\nStunned and having nowhere else to go, Foley stumbled to his bedroom.
