0,0,"miller street begins at baker street and runs directly east for 4.5 kilometers until it ends when it meets turner street . miller street is intersected every 250 meters by a perpendicular street , and each of those streets other than baker street and turner street is given a number beginning at 1 st street ( one block east of baker street ) and continuing consecutively ( 2 nd street , 3 rd street , etc . . . ) until the highest - numbered street one block west of turner street . what is the highest - numbered street that intersects miller street ? The options are: a ) 15 th , b ) 16 th , c ) 17 th , d ) 18 th , e ) 19 th",c,b,c,"['NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Determine the total length of Miller Street, which is given as 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
step 2: Calculate the number of 250-meter segments in 4500 meters. This is done by dividing the total length of Miller Street by the distance between each intersecting street, i.e., 4500 meters / 250 meters.
step 3: The result from step 2 gives the total number of segments, including the segment from Baker Street to 1st Street and the segment from the last numbered street to Turner Street. Therefore, the total number of segments is 4500 / 250 = 18.
step 4: Since the first segment (from Baker Street to 1st Street) and the last segment (from the highest-numbered street to Turner Street) are not named after numbers, the highest-numbered street would be the total number of segments minus 2. This is because we exclude the first and last segments from the numbering.
step 5: Calculate the highest-numbered street by subtracting 2 from the total number of segments found in step 3. Therefore, the highest-numbered street is 18 - 2 = 16.","Step 1: Determine the total length of Miller Street, which is given as 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
Step 2: Calculate the number of 250-meter segments in 4500 meters. This is done by dividing the total length of Miller Street by the distance between each intersecting street, i.e., 4500 meters / 250 meters.
Step 3: Since there are 18 segments in total, and the numbering starts at 1st Street (one block east of Baker Street), the last numbered street would be one less than the total number of segments. Therefore, the highest-numbered street is the 17th Street, which is one block west of Turner Street.
Step 4: The question provides options for the highest-numbered street: a) 15th, b) 16th, c) 17th, d) 18th, e) 19th.
Step 5: Based on the thought process, the correct answer is that the highest-numbered street intersecting Miller Street is 17th Street.
Step 6: Among the given options, the correct choice is option c) 17th."
1,1,"a leak in the bottom of a tank can empty the full tank in 6 hours . an inlet pipe fills water at the rate of 3 liters per minute . when the tank is full in inlet is opened and due to the leak the tank is empties in 8 hours . the capacity of the tank is ? The options are: a ) 5729 , b ) 5760 , c ) 2889 , d ) 2870 , e ) 4320",e,e,e,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","step 1: Understand that the leak empties the tank in 6 hours. This means the leak empties 1/6 of the tank per hour.
step 2: The inlet pipe fills the tank at a rate of 3 liters per minute, which is 3*60 = 180 liters per hour.
step 3: When both the inlet and the leak are open, the tank empties in 8 hours. This means the net effect (inlet - leak) empties the tank in 8 hours, or fills -1/8 of the tank per hour (negative because it's emptying).
step 4: Let's denote the capacity of the tank as 'C' liters. The leak empties C/6 liters per hour, and the inlet fills 180 liters per hour.
step 5: The net effect when both are open is a loss of C/8 liters per hour (since it empties in 8 hours).
step 6: Set up the equation based on the net effect: 180 - C/6 = -C/8.
step 7: Multiply the entire equation by 24 (LCM of 6 and 8) to clear the denominators: 24*180 - 4C = -3C.
step 8: Simplify the equation: 4320 - 4C = -3C.
step 9: Solve for C: 4320 = C.
step 10: Therefore, the capacity of the tank is 4320 liters.","step 1: Understand that the leak empties the tank in 6 hours. This means the leak empties 1/6 of the tank per hour.
