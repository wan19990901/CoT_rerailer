step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
step 3: Calculate the number of sections created by these intersections. Since the first and last streets (Baker and Turner) are not numbered and the streets are 250 meters apart, divide the total length by the distance between intersections: 4500 meters / 250 meters = 18.
step 4: Realize that the calculation in step 3 gives the total number of sections, but since Baker and Turner streets are not numbered, the highest numbered street will be one less than the total number of sections.

step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantity of A and B taken out will be in the same ratio of 3:2. So, 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B are taken out if we consider the 5 liters as being proportionate to the original ratio.
step 4: However, this step is incorrect because we don't know the exact amount of A and B taken out without knowing x. We should instead calculate the effect of adding 5 liters of B directly.
step 5: After removing 5 liters of the mixture, we add 5 liters of B, so the amount of B increases by 5 liters.
step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Let's denote the new quantities of A and B as A' and B' respectively.
step 7: Since the quantity of A does not change when B is added, A' = 3x.
step 8: The new quantity of B, B' = 2x + 5.
step 9: The new ratio 3:5 can be represented as A'/B' = 3/5. Substituting A' and B' gives 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5.

step 3: On non-rainy days, Mo drinks exactly 5 cups of tea, so the total cups of tea drunk in a week is '5*nr'.

Since the tomato juice is 90% water, it means 10% of it is solid content.
step 2: Calculate the amount of solid content in 80 liters of tomato juice. Since 10% of it is solid, 80 liters * 10% = 8 liters of solid content.
step 3: Understand that the process of boiling tomato juice into puree only removes water, so the amount of solid content remains the same.
step 4: Since the tomato puree has 20% water, it means 80% of it is solid content.
step 5: Set up an equation to find out how many liters of tomato puree will contain 8 liters of solid content, knowing that this solid content represents 80% of the total puree volume. Let x be the total volume of the puree. Therefore, 80% of x = 8 liters.
step 6: Solve the equation for x. 0.80 * x = 8 liters, which simplifies to x = 8 / 0.80.
step 7: Calculate the value of x. x = 10 liters.
step 8: Compare the calculated value of x with the given options.","['step 1: Identify the amount of water and solid content in the tomato juice.

step 2: Recognize that for a 50 Hz supply, one cycle consists of two half cycles. 
step 3: Realize that the question asks for the one cycle surge current, which might imply the total current the SCR can handle over a full cycle, or it might be interpreted as the peak current for a full cycle. 
step 4: Understand that the surge current rating given (3000 A) is for a half cycle, and this value does not double for a full cycle since the rating is about the peak current it can handle at any instant, not a cumulative value over time. 
step 5: Conclude that the one cycle surge current rating would remain the same as the half cycle surge current rating because it represents the peak current the SCR can handle, which does not change whether considering a half cycle or a full cycle. 
step 6: Therefore, the correct answer is not about adding or averaging the half cycle ratings but understanding the nature of the rating itself.","['step 1: Understand that the half cycle surge current rating of an SCR refers to the maximum current it can handle for a half cycle of the AC supply without getting damaged.', 'step 2: Recognize that for a 50 Hz supply, one cycle consists of two half cycles.', 'step 3: Realize that the question asks for the one cycle surge current, which might imply the total current the SCR can handle over a full cycle, or it might be interpreted as the peak current for a full cycle.', 'step 4: Understand that the surge current rating given (3000 A) is for a half cycle, and this value does not double for a full cycle since the rating is about the peak current it can handle at any instant, not a cumulative value over time.', 'step 5: Conclude that the one cycle surge current rating would remain the same as the half cycle surge current rating because it represents the peak current the SCR can handle, which does not change whether considering a half cycle or a full cycle.', 'step 6: Therefore, the correct answer is not about adding or averaging the half cycle ratings but understanding the nature of the rating itself.']"

The options are: A) Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies., B) Postcolonialism takes account not only of major war, but also of so-called 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts., C) Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics., D) Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.",A,C,C,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","step 1: Understand that postcolonialism is a theoretical approach that seeks to address the impacts of colonialism on cultures, societies, and relations, including in the realm of security studies. It often emphasizes the perspectives and experiences of the colonized or formerly colonized peoples.
step 2: Evaluate option A, which states that postcolonialism considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies. This aligns with postcolonialism's focus on non-Western perspectives and the importance of local and indigenous contexts, making it a feature of postcolonialism rather than a distinction from other perspectives.
step 3: Consider option B, which mentions postcolonialism's attention to 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts. This is consistent with postcolonialism's broader view of security that goes beyond traditional state-centric and major war focuses, thus it is a defining feature of postcolonialism.
step 4: Look at option C, which highlights postcolonialism's focus on the role of violence in world politics. While postcolonialism does critically examine violence, including colonial violence, this focus is not unique to postcolonialism as other theories, such as realism and critical security studies, also consider the role of violence in world politics.
step 5: Review option D, which asserts that postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge. This is a key aspect of postcolonialism, as it seeks to decenter Eurocentric views and incorporate perspectives from the Global South and other marginalized voices, making it a defining feature.
