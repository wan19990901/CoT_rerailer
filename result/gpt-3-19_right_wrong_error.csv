step 2: Identify the conditional proposition in the given statement: 'The Bees win their first game only if either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.'
step 3: Recognize that 'only if' indicates a conditional relationship where the part after 'only if' is necessary for the part before it. This means the part after 'only if' is the consequent, and the part before it is the antecedent.
step 4: Identify the antecedent based on step 3. The antecedent is the condition that needs to be true for the consequent to possibly be true. In this case, 'The Bees win their first game' is the condition that depends on the other part of the statement.
step 5: Match the identified antecedent with the given options. The correct match is 'The Bees win their first game.', which is option B.","Step 1: Understand the structure of a conditional proposition, which is typically in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

step 2: Given that Rani sells apples at ₹23 apiece with a 15% profit, we can calculate the cost price of an apple. The selling price (SP) of an apple is ₹23, and the profit is 15%, so the cost price (CP) can be found using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%). Therefore, A = 23 / 1.15.
step 3: Similarly, Rani sells oranges at ₹10 apiece with a 25% profit. So, using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%), we find that O = 10 / 1.25.
step 4: Let's denote the number of apples sold by 'x' and the number of oranges sold by 'y'. The total revenue from selling all apples and oranges is ₹653, so we have the equation 23x + 10y = 653.
step 5: To find the profit percentage, we first need to calculate the total cost price (TCP) and the total selling price (TSP). TCP = Ax + Oy, and TSP = 653.
step 6: However, we don't have enough information to directly solve for 'x' and 'y'. Instead, we focus on calculating the total cost and then the profit percentage. The profit is given by Profit = TSP - TCP.
step 7: Calculate A and O from steps 2 and 3. A = 23 / 1.15 = 20, O = 10 / 1.25 = 8.
step 8: Since we cannot directly calculate 'x' and 'y', we focus on the profit percentage formula, which is Profit% = (Profit / TCP) * 100. We know TSP = 653, but we need to find a way to estimate TCP and then calculate the profit.
step 9: The challenge here is that without the exact numbers of apples and oranges sold, we cannot directly calculate TCP or the profit. However, we can infer that the profit percentage must be calculated based on the given options and the understanding that the profit percentage is a weighted average of the individual profit percentages of apples and oranges, which are 15% and 25% respectively. Since more apples were sold and their profit percentage is lower, the overall profit percentage should be closer to 15% but higher due to the contribution of oranges.
step 10: Given the options and the analysis, we can estimate that the correct option should be slightly above 15% but not exceeding the 25% mark, making option (b) 17.4% a reasonable estimate based on the given information and the constraints of the problem.","Step 1: Let's denote the cost price of an apple as 'A' and the cost price of an orange as 'O'.

Then, calculate TCP = Ax + Oy and use the profit formula Profit = TSP - TCP. Finally, calculate the profit percentage using Profit% = (Profit / TCP) * 100. Without the exact values of 'x' and 'y', we cannot proceed to calculate the profit percentage accurately. *<verified>*
Step 10: Recognizing the limitation in Step 9, we must acknowledge that without additional information or constraints, we cannot solve for 'x' and 'y' directly. A different approach or additional data is required to proceed.

step 2: Identify the number of applicants who majored in political science, which is 15.
step 3: Identify the number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0, which is 20.
step 4: Identify the number of applicants who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 10.
step 5: Calculate the number of applicants who did not major in political science, which is 40 (total applicants) - 15 (majored in political science) = 25.
step 6: Calculate the number of applicants with a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 40 (total applicants) - 20 (GPA higher than 3.0) = 20.
step 7: Since 10 applicants did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, subtract this from the totals calculated in steps 5 and 6 to find the overlap in the remaining groups.
step 8: Calculate the number of applicants who majored in political science and had a GPA higher than 3.0. Since there are 15 applicants who majored in political science and 20 with a GPA higher than 3.0, and knowing that 10 are outside these groups, we can find the intersection by adding the counts of political science majors and high GPA applicants (15 + 20) and subtracting the non-overlapping group (10) and the total applicants (40) to avoid double counting. However, this approach seems incorrect upon review because it does not directly address the overlap between political science majors and high GPA applicants.
step 9: Correcting the approach, we realize that the direct calculation of the intersection is not straightforward from the given information. Instead, we know that out of the 25 applicants who did not major in political science, 10 had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, leaving 15 who did not major in political science but had a GPA higher than 3.0. Therefore, to find the number of political science majors with a GPA higher than 3.0, we subtract from the total number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0 those who did not major in political science but had a high GPA. This gives us 20 (applicants with GPA > 3.0) - 15 (non-political science majors with GPA > 3.0) = 5.

Step 8: Calculate the total number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0 who also majored in political science.

step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:12 or simplified to 1:4.
step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half the standard, making it 1:60.
step 4: Since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation is 1:4, and there are 3 ounces of corn syrup, it means there is 3/4 ounces of flavoring (because for every 4 parts of corn syrup, there is 1 part of flavoring).
step 5: Knowing there is 3/4 ounces of flavoring and the ratio of flavoring to water is 1:60, calculate the amount of water. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 60 parts of water. Therefore, for 3/4 parts of flavoring, there would be (3/4)*60 parts of water.
step 6: Perform the calculation from step 5: (3/4)*60 = 45.
step 7: Conclude that the large bottle of the 'sport' formulation contains 45 ounces of water.","Step 1: Identify the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water in the standard formulation, which is 1:12:30.
Step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:36. This simplifies to 1:12, not 1:4 as previously stated. *<verified>*
Step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half that of the standard formulation. The standard ratio is 1:30, so the new ratio is 1:15.
Step 4: Combine the new ratios to get the complete ratio for the sport formulation, which is 1:12:15 for flavoring:corn syrup:water.
Step 5: Given that there are 3 ounces of corn syrup in a large bottle of the sport formulation, and the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:12, we can determine that there is 1/4 ounce of flavoring (since 3 ounces of corn syrup corresponds to 1/12 of the total ratio for corn syrup).
Step 6: To find the amount of water, we use the ratio of flavoring to water, which is 1:15. Since there is 1/4 ounce of flavoring, we multiply 1/4 by 15 to find the amount of water.
Step 7: Multiplying 1/4 by 15 gives 15/4 ounces of water, which simplifies to 3.75 ounces.
Step 8: Realize there was a mistake in Step 5 regarding the calculation of flavoring amount based on the ratio of corn syrup. The correct approach is to recognize that if the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:12, and there are 3 ounces of corn syrup, then for every 12 ounces of corn syrup, there is 1 ounce of flavoring. Therefore, the bottle contains 1/4 ounce of flavoring.
Step 9: Correcting the mistake, since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is correctly applied, we should directly use the ratio of corn syrup to water (12:15) to find the amount of water, given the amount of corn syrup.
Step 10: Since the ratio of corn syrup to water is 12:15, and we have 3 ounces of corn syrup, we calculate the amount of water by setting up a proportion. If 12 ounces of corn syrup correspond to 15 ounces of water, then 3 ounces of corn syrup correspond to how many ounces of water?
Step 11: Solving the proportion (12/15 = 3/x), we find that x = (3*15)/12.
Step 12: Calculating (3*15)/12 gives us 3.75 ounces of water, which indicates a mistake in calculation. Correct calculation should be based on the correct understanding of ratios and proportions, leading to a reevaluation of the steps to accurately determine the amount of water."
