We are given a permutation p in the symmetric group S_5 and asked to find the index of the subgroup generated by p, denoted <p>, in S_5. The index of a subgroup H in a group G is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G, which is equal to |G|/|H|, where |G| is the order of G and |H| is the order of H.
Step 2: Calculate the order of S_5. The order of the symmetric group S_n is n!, so for S_5, the order is 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.
Step 3: Determine the order of p. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the cycles in the cycle decomposition of p. The permutation p is given as (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), which can be simplified to (1, 3, 2, 5, 4) after combining the cycles since 2 appears in both cycles. The length of this cycle is 5, so the order of p is 5, which is the number of times we need to apply p to get the identity permutation.
Step 4: Calculate the index of <p> in S_5 using the formula |G|/|H|, where |G| is the order of S_5 and |H| is the order of p. From steps 2 and 3, we have |G| = 120 and |H| = 5.
Step 5: Perform the division to find the index: 120 / 5 = 24.

The permutation p is given as (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3). These are two separate cycles, one of length 4 and the other of length 2. Therefore, the order of p is the LCM of 4 and 2, which is 4. *<verified>*
Step 4: Calculate the index of <p> in S_5. Using the formula for the index of a subgroup, we have |S_5|/|<p>| = 120/4 = 30.
Step 5: Realize there is a mistake in the initial thought process regarding the cycle decomposition of p. The correct cycle decomposition should be considered as a single entity because the cycles are not disjoint. The correct decomposition is (1, 2, 3, 5, 4), which is a single cycle of length 5.
Step 6: Correct the order of p based on the corrected cycle decomposition. Since there is now only one cycle of length 5, the order of p is 5.
Step 7: Recalculate the index of <p> in S_5 with the corrected order of p. The new calculation is |S_5|/|<p>| = 120/5 = 24.

The correct disjoint cycle representation is (1, 2, 3, 5, 4).

The permutation p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) needs to be accurately decomposed into disjoint cycles. The correct approach involves tracing the action of p on each element in sequence, leading to a correct disjoint cycle representation. For p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), the accurate decomposition is (1, 3)(2, 5, 4). The order of p is then the LCM of the lengths of these cycles, which is LCM(2, 3) = 6.

3,3,"Statement 1 | Every group of order 159 is cyclic. Statement 2 | Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. The options are: A) True, True, B) False, False, C) True, False, D) False, True",a,a,a,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO']","Step 1: Analyze Statement 1. The order of a group is 159, which is equal to 3 * 53. Both 3 and 53 are prime numbers, and their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. According to a theorem in group theory, if G is a finite group whose order is the product of two primes p and q, where p < q, and if p does not divide q - 1, then G is cyclic. In this case, 3 does not divide 53 - 1 = 52, so any group of order 159 should be cyclic. Thus, Statement 1 is true.
Step 2: Analyze Statement 2. The order of a group is 102, which is equal to 2 * 3 * 17. According to the Sylow theorems, for any prime factor p of the order of a group, there exists a subgroup of order p^n, where p^n is the highest power of p dividing the group's order. For a group of order 102, there would be subgroups of orders 2, 3, and 17. At least one of these subgroups (specifically, the ones of order 17 or 3, being prime) must be normal because their orders are prime and thus their number of Sylow subgroups is constrained by the group order in a way that often forces at least one to be normal. Therefore, a group of order 102 must have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, making Statement 2 true.

The inverse of a is The options are: A) 0, B) -2, C) a-2, D) (2+a)*-1",d,d,"given the misunderstanding in the initial thought process, a direct answer based on it is not feasible without correcting the foundational errors.","['NO', 'YES']","step 1: Recall the definition of an inverse in a group. For an element a in a group G, the inverse of a, denoted as a^(-1), is the element that, when combined with a using the group operation, yields the identity element of the group. In mathematical terms, a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e, where e is the identity element of the group.
step 2: Identify the identity element e of the group (Z,*). The identity element is defined such that for any a in Z, a * e = e * a = a. Given the operation a*b = a + b + 1, we need to find e such that a + e + 1 = a. Solving for e, we get e = -1, since a + (-1) + 1 = a.
step 3: Use the definition of the inverse to find a^(-1) such that a * a^(-1) = e, where e = -1. Substituting the operation, we get a + a^(-1) + 1 = -1.
step 4: Solve the equation from step 3 for a^(-1). We have a + a^(-1) + 1 = -1. Rearranging, we get a^(-1) = -2 - a.
step 5: Compare the expression for a^(-1) with the given options. The expression a^(-1) = -2 - a matches the transformation of option D, which is (2+a)*-1, after considering the arithmetic operation priorities and the distributive property.","Step 1: Recall the definition of an inverse in a group. For an element a in a group G, the inverse of a, denoted as a^(-1), is the element that, when combined with a using the group operation, yields the identity element of the group. In mathematical terms, a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e, where e is the identity element of the group.
Step 2: Identify the identity element e of the group (Z,*). The identity element is defined such that for any a in Z, a * e = e * a = a. Given the operation a*b = a + b + 1, we need to find e such that a + e + 1 = a for all a in Z. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that no such e exists that satisfies this equation for all a in Z, indicating that the operation defined does not form a group under the set of integers Z, as it fails to have an identity element. This realization is crucial in understanding that the structure (Z,*) with the given operation cannot be considered a group. *<verified>*
Step 3: Despite the realization in Step 2, for the sake of argument and to address the question, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where we proceed to find an 'inverse' under the given operation, keeping in mind the operation's definition a*b = a + b + 1.
Step 4: To find the inverse of a, denoted as a^(-1), we need to find a value such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e, where e is the hypothetical identity element. Since we've established that an identity element in the traditional sense does not exist for this operation, we'll proceed under the assumption that we're looking for a value that, when operated with a, brings us back to a scenario that would resemble the identity property.
Step 5: Given the operation a*b = a + b + 1, to find a^(-1), we set up the equation a + a^(-1) + 1 = a. Solving for a^(-1), we get a^(-1) = -1 - a.
Step 6: To verify this 'inverse', we substitute a^(-1) into the operation with a. So, a * a^(-1) = a + (-1 - a) + 1 = a - a = 0, which does not align with the traditional identity element but shows the operation bringing the result to a constant value under the operation's unique definition.
Step 7: Since the options provided do not include the exact form derived (-1 - a), we need to re-evaluate the options in the context of the operation's definition and the mistake in the calculation in Step 5.
Step 8: Correcting the mistake in Step 5, the correct equation to find a^(-1) should be a + a^(-1) + 1 = e, where we aim for e to be the operation's identity element. Given the error in identifying the identity element initially, we reconsider the operation to correctly solve for a^(-1).
Step 9: Realizing the mistake in the calculation and the incorrect conclusion about the identity element's existence, we acknowledge that the initial approach was flawed due to a misunderstanding of the operation's implications.
Step 10: Given the corrected understanding, we should find the inverse by correctly applying the operation's definition and ensuring the equation aligns with the group's properties, which was not accurately followed in the initial steps.
Step 11: Since the initial thought process contained a critical misunderstanding regarding the group's properties and the operation's implications, a direct continuation towards finding the correct inverse based on the flawed premise is not feasible without re-establishing the correct group properties and operation understanding.
Step 12: Therefore, a re-evaluation of the group's properties and a correct application of the operation's definition are necessary to accurately answer the question, which requires revisiting the foundational aspects of group theory and the specific operation defined in the question."

This implies that the cyclic subgroup generated by this element has exactly 15 elements, all of which are distinct powers of the element. However, not all of these elements necessarily have order 15. The only elements that would have order 15 are those powers that are relatively prime to 15 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14), because only these powers generate the entire subgroup when raised to their respective powers.

We have two functions, f: A -> B and g: B -> A, with the property that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This means that the composition of g after f is the identity function on A. 
step 2: Analyze Statement 1. To determine if g is injective, we need to check if, for any b1, b2 in B, g(b1) = g(b2) implies b1 = b2. However, the given information does not directly address this. Instead, it tells us about the composition g(f(a)), which suggests that f has a right inverse (g). This implies that f is surjective, but it does not directly imply anything about the injectivity of g. 
step 3: To further analyze Statement 1, consider that if g were not injective, there would be two elements b1, b2 in B such that g(b1) = g(b2) but b1 != b2. However, this does not contradict the given information directly because the condition g(f(a)) = a does not require g to be injective, only that for every a in A, there is a b in B such that g(b) = a.

The given condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A directly implies that g is surjective, because for every a in A, we can find a b (specifically, f(a)) such that g(b) = a. 
step 5: Conclude that Statement 1 is false because the given information does not necessarily imply that g is injective. 
step 6: Conclude that Statement 2 is true because the given information directly implies that g is surjective.","Step 1: Understand the given information. We have two functions, f: A -> B and g: B -> A, with the property that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This means that the composition of g after f is the identity function on A.

The given information about the composition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A actually provides a basis for analyzing the injectivity of g indirectly. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, and if we assume g(b1) = g(b2) for some b1, b2 in B, then if b1 and b2 are images under f of some a1, a2 in A (i.e., b1=f(a1) and b2=f(a2)), it follows from the property of g that a1 = a2, which implies b1 = b2 if b1 and b2 are in the range of f. However, to conclude g's injectivity across all B without information about f being surjective, we cannot directly infer g is injective across all elements of B solely based on this property. Further analysis is required to determine the injectivity of g across all elements of B.
Step 3: Analyze Statement 2. To determine if g is surjective, we need to check if for every element a in A, there exists an element b in B such that g(b) = a. Given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means for every a in A, there is at least one b (specifically, b = f(a)) in B such that g(b) = a. This directly implies that every element of A is accounted for by the function g, making g surjective.
Step 4: Reevaluate Statement 1 with additional insight. Given the surjectivity of g from Step 3, we know that every element in A has a pre-image in B. However, the initial analysis in Step 2 highlighted a potential gap in directly proving g's injectivity without assuming f's surjectivity. The key point missed is that the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A inherently ensures that g is a right inverse of f, but it does not directly impose conditions on g's injectivity without further assumptions about f.
Step 5: Conclusion for Statement 1. Without additional information about f being surjective (which would ensure that every element of B maps to some element of A, making g injective by necessity), we cannot conclusively say that g is injective. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.
Step 6: Conclusion for Statement 2. Based on the analysis in Step 3, g is surjective because it maps at least one element from B to every element in A. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.

Step 3: Evaluate the purpose for which the evidence is being offered. The evidence is being offered to show a pattern of behavior that is highly specific and distinctive, which could be relevant to proving the identity of the perpetrator in the current case. 
Step 4: Consider the exception to the rule against character evidence. Evidence of prior bad acts may be admissible if it is offered for purposes other than simply to show a propensity to commit the crime, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. 
Step 5: Assess the potential for unfair prejudice versus probative value. While the evidence is potentially prejudicial, its probative value in establishing the identity of the perpetrator based on a highly distinctive modus operandi could be considered significant. 
Step 6: Determine the most appropriate option based on the analysis. Given that the evidence is being offered to establish identity through a unique modus operandi, and not merely to show character, the correct option would likely be the one that allows for its admissibility on those grounds.","Step 1: Understand the nature of the evidence being offered.

9,9,"A woman had spent many years converting her back yard to an authentic Japanese-style garden. Her garden had become a showplace for the neighborhood, and various civic groups and organizations frequently visited the woman's property to enjoy the beauty of the yard. Recently, the woman had read about a particular cymbidium that was native to Japan. Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the woman's garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor. Two weeks later, agricultural officials discovered that a special type of beetle that attacked citrus plants had adapted to using cymbidiums for nesting purposes. The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch. Fearing for the safety of the citrus crops in the United States, the United States government adopted a ban on the importation of all cymbidiums grown in foreign countries. As a result, the distributor was not able to acquire the cymbidium for the woman. Which of the following best states the legal relationship at this point between the distributor the woman? The options are: A) The distributor's performance was excused because of impossibility, but the woman can seek restitution., B) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages because of the distributor's prospective inability to perform., C) The distributor's performance was not excused because of the supervening illegality, and the woman can recover damages, provided she waits until the date performance was due before filing suit., D) Both parties are excused from performance because of the supervening illegality, and neither can recover from the other.",a,a,a,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","Step 1: Understand the scenario where a contract was made between the woman and the distributor for the import and planting of a cymbidium from Japan for $5,000, with $1,000 paid upfront.
Step 2: Recognize the supervening event - the U.S. government's ban on the importation of all cymbidiums due to a beetle infestation, which made it illegal for the distributor to fulfill the contract.
Step 3: Identify the legal principle of 'impossibility' which occurs when a party cannot legally or physically perform the contract due to an unforeseen event.
Step 4: Analyze the principle of 'supervening illegality' which occurs when a change in law makes the performance of the contract illegal.
Step 5: Determine that the distributor's inability to perform is due to a change in law (supervening illegality), making it impossible to legally fulfill the contract.

10,10,"A state election code provides that any political organization whose candidate received 20% or more of the vote at the most recent gubernatorial or presidential election is a political party; other political organizations are construed as political bodies. Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries.

Step 4: Simplify the calculation to find ΔKE. ΔKE = 1/2 * 10 * 4 - 1/2 * 10 * 1 = 20 - 5 = 15 Joules.
Step 5: Use the work-energy principle, which states that the work done on the box is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Work done (W) = ΔKE.
Step 6: Calculate the work done using the formula W = F * d, where F is the force applied and d is the distance over which the force is applied. Given that W = 15 Joules (from Step 4) and d = 5 m (from the problem statement), we can solve for F. Rearranging the formula gives F = W / d = 15 Joules / 5 m = 3 N. Therefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N, which corresponds to option C. *<verified>*"
