step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
step 3: Calculate the number of sections created by these intersections. Since the first and last streets (Baker and Turner) are not numbered and the streets are 250 meters apart, divide the total length by the distance between intersections: 4500 meters / 250 meters = 18.
step 4: Realize that the calculation in step 3 gives the total number of sections, but since Baker and Turner streets are not numbered, the highest numbered street will be one less than the total number of sections.
step 5: Subtract 1 from the total number of sections to find the highest numbered street: 18 - 1 = 17.","step 1: Identify the total length of Miller Street, which is 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
Step 3: Correctly calculate the number of sections that will be numbered. Since the first and last intersections are not numbered and the streets are 250 meters apart, the total length of Miller Street should be divided by the distance between intersections and then subtract 1 to account for the first unnumbered section: (4500 meters / 250 meters) - 1 = 17. The highest-numbered street that intersects Miller Street is the 17th street."
1,1,"a bucket contains 2 mixtures a and b in the ratio 3 : 2 . if 5 liters of the mixture is replaced by 5 liters of liquid b , then the ratio of the two liquids becomes 3 : 5 . how much of the liquid a was there in the bucket ? The options are: a ) 8 liters , b ) 10 liters , c ) 12 liters , d ) 15 liters , e ) 18 liters",a,d,a,"['NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Let the initial quantities of mixtures A and B be 3x and 2x liters respectively, since the ratio is 3:2.
step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantity of A and B taken out will be in the same ratio of 3:2. So, 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B are taken out if we consider the 5 liters as being proportionate to the original ratio.
step 4: However, this step is incorrect because we don't know the exact amount of A and B taken out without knowing x. We should instead calculate the effect of adding 5 liters of B directly.
step 5: After removing 5 liters of the mixture, we add 5 liters of B, so the amount of B increases by 5 liters.
step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Let's denote the new quantities of A and B as A' and B' respectively.
step 7: Since the quantity of A does not change when B is added, A' = 3x.
step 8: The new quantity of B, B' = 2x + 5.
step 9: The new ratio 3:5 can be represented as A'/B' = 3/5. Substituting A' and B' gives 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5.
step 10: Solving the equation 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5 gives x = 5. Therefore, the initial quantity of A was 3x = 3*5 = 15 liters.","Step 1: Let the initial quantities of mixtures A and B be 3x and 2x liters respectively, since the ratio is 3:2.
Step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
Step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantity of A and B taken out will still be in the ratio of 3:2. To accurately determine the quantities of A and B removed, we apply the ratio to the 5 liters proportionally. This means 3 parts of the total 5 parts (3+2) of the mixture are A, and 2 parts are B. Therefore, (3/5)*5 liters of A and (2/5)*5 liters of B are taken out, which equals 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B.
Step 4: After removing 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B, 5 liters of B is added. This changes the quantities of A and B in the bucket.
Step 5: The new quantity of A in the bucket is now (3x - 3) liters, and the new quantity of B is (2x - 2 + 5) liters, which simplifies to (2x + 3) liters.
Step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Therefore, the equation based on the new quantities is (3x - 3)/(2x + 3) = 3/5.
Step 7: Cross-multiplying to solve for x, we get 5(3x - 3) = 3(2x + 3).
Step 8: Simplifying the equation, 15x - 15 = 6x + 9.
Step 9: Bringing all x terms to one side and constants to the other, we get 15x - 6x = 9 + 15, which simplifies to 9x = 24.
Step 10: Solving for x, we find x = 24/9, which simplifies further to x = 8/3.
Step 11: The initial quantity of A was 3x liters. Substituting x = 8/3, we get the initial quantity of A as 3*(8/3) = 8 liters.
Step 12: Therefore, the initial quantity of liquid A in the bucket was 8 liters, which corresponds to option (a)."

step 2: Notice that these numbers are all perfect cubes or squares: 81 (9^2), 64 (8^2 or 4^3), 27 (3^3), 16 (4^2).
step 3: Identify the pattern in the sequence. The sequence alternates between squares and cubes: square (9^2), cube (4^3), cube (3^3), square (4^2).
step 4: Recognize that the sequence is decreasing and alternates between the square of a number and the cube of a smaller number.
step 5: Predict the next term in the sequence. Since the last number given is 16 (4^2), the next number should be a cube.
step 6: Determine the next smaller cube after 27 (3^3), which is 8 (2^3).
step 7: Realize that step 6 was incorrect in predicting the pattern, as the sequence actually follows a pattern of decreasing perfect squares and cubes without repeating the base number. The correct next step is to find the square or cube smaller than 16 (4^2) that follows the pattern.
step 8: Since the pattern involves decreasing numbers and the last number is a square, the next number should be a cube smaller than 16. The cube smaller than 16 is 8 (2^3), but it does not fit the alternating pattern correctly. The correct observation is that after 16 (4^2), we should look for a square smaller than 16, which is 9 (3^2), but 9 does not fit as it breaks the sequence of unique bases. The correct approach is to recognize the mistake in the pattern analysis and correctly identify that after 16, the sequence should logically continue with a smaller number that fits the observed pattern of squares and cubes. The correct next term, following the corrected understanding of the pattern, is actually 1 (1^1 or 1^2 or 1^3), as it is the next perfect power (square or cube) that follows the descending order.
step 9: Correct the analysis to conclude that the next number in the sequence, following the corrected pattern of descending perfect powers, is 1.","Step 1: Observe the given sequence: 81, 64, 27, 16, ....

3,3,"2 ^ 46655 mod 9 = ? The options are: a ) 4 , b ) 5 , c ) 6 , d ) 7 , e ) 8",b,e,b,"['NO', 'YES']","step 1: Recognize that the problem asks for the remainder when 2^46655 is divided by 9.
step 2: Recall Euler's theorem, which states that for any integer a coprime with n, a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n), where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. However, since 2 and 9 are not coprime (they share a common factor, which is 1), we cannot directly apply Euler's theorem.
step 3: Notice that we can simplify the problem by finding a pattern in the powers of 2 modulo 9. Start by calculating the first few powers of 2 mod 9: 2^1 mod 9 = 2, 2^2 mod 9 = 4, 2^3 mod 9 = 8, 2^4 mod 9 = 7, 2^5 mod 9 = 5, 2^6 mod 9 = 1, and then it repeats.
step 4: Observe that the powers of 2 modulo 9 cycle every 6 steps: 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1.
step 5: Since the cycle repeats every 6 steps, we can find the remainder of 46655 divided by 6 to determine where in the cycle 2^46655 falls. 46655 mod 6 = 3.
step 6: According to our cycle, the third number in the sequence is 8. Therefore, 2^46655 mod 9 = 8.","Step 1: Recognize that the problem asks for the remainder when 2^46655 is divided by 9.

step 3: Calculate the work done by one press in one hour, which is the result from step 2.
Step 4: Calculate how many hours it would take for 30 presses to print 500,000 papers. Since the work rate of one press is known (from step 3), and the total work (500,000 papers) remains the same, use the formula: Time = Total Work / (Work Rate of One Press * 30).

step 2: The man sells the article at a profit of 25%, so the selling price is x + 25% of x = 1.25x.
step 3: If he had bought it at 20% less, the new cost price would be x - 20% of x = 0.8x.
step 4: He would have sold it for Rs. 14.70 less, so the new selling price is 1.25x - 14.70.
step 5: At this new selling price, he would have gained 30%, so the new selling price is 0.8x + 30% of 0.8x = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 6: Equate the two expressions for the new selling price: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 7: Simplify the equation: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.04x.

Step 4: The new selling price, considering a 30% profit on the new cost price (0.8x), should be calculated as 0.8x * 1.30. However, to correctly incorporate the condition that he sold it for Rs. 14.70 less, we should express the new selling price as 1.25x - 14.70, and set it equal to the calculated new selling price with a 30% profit, which is 0.8x * 1.30. This establishes the correct relationship between the original selling price, the reduction in selling price, and the new profit margin.

The options are: a ) 2 , b ) 4 , c ) 3 , d ) 5 , e ) 6",b,b,the thought process provided does not lead to a conclusive answer without further clarification or correction. the correct approach involves solving the system of equations or using logical reasoning with the given options.,"['NO', 'YES']","step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
step 2: Since Mo drinks n cups of hot chocolate on rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate drunk in a week is 'n*r'.
step 3: On non-rainy days, Mo drinks exactly 5 cups of tea, so the total cups of tea drunk in a week is '5*nr'.
step 4: We are given that Mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together, which gives us the equation: n*r + 5*nr = 22.
step 5: We are also given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, which gives us the equation: 5*nr = n*r + 8.
step 6: Since there are 7 days in a week, we have another equation: r + nr = 7.
step 7: From step 5, we can simplify to nr = r + 8/5, but since nr and r must be integers, this equation seems incorrect in the context. Correcting the interpretation: the correct equation from the given information is 5*nr - n*r = 8.
step 8: Substituting nr = 7 - r into the equation from step 7 gives us 5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8. However, realizing the mistake in step 7, we should directly use the information to solve the problem without misinterpreting the equations.
step 9: Correct approach: Let's use the information directly. Total drinks = 22, and tea cups are 8 more than hot chocolate cups. If we let 't' be the number of tea cups and 'h' be the number of hot chocolate cups, we have t + h = 22 and t = h + 8. Solving these equations gives us t = 15 and h = 7. Since Mo drinks 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, nr = 15/5 = 3. Therefore, r = 7 - 3 = 4 rainy days.
step 10: Correcting the mistake in step 7 and following the correct approach in step 9 leads us to the correct number of rainy days.","Step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
Step 2: Since Mo drinks n cups of hot chocolate on rainy days and 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, we need to account for both to find the total cups drunk in a week. Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'. The total cups of hot chocolate drunk in a week is 'n*r', and the total cups of tea drunk in a week is '5*nr'. Given that the total cups of tea and hot chocolate drunk together last week is 22, we have the equation 'n*r + 5*nr = 22'.
Step 3: It's also given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate. This gives us another equation: '5*nr - n*r = 8'.
Step 4: We know there are 7 days in a week, which means 'r + nr = 7'.
Step 5: From Step 4, we can express 'nr' as '7 - r'. Substituting 'nr' in the equation from Step 3 gives us '5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8'.
Step 6: Simplifying the equation from Step 5 gives '35 - 5r - n*r = 8'.
Step 7: Rearranging the equation from Step 6 gives 'n*r + 5r = 27'.
Step 8: Since 'n*r' represents the cups of hot chocolate and '5r' represents the cups of tea on rainy days, and we know the total cups, we can deduce that 'r' must be the number of rainy days we are looking for.
Step 9: However, we made a mistake in our thought process; we should have used the original equations to solve for 'r' directly. Let's correct this by focusing on the equations 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' and '5*nr - n*r = 8'.
Step 10: Substituting 'nr = 7 - r' into 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' gives us a single equation in terms of 'r'.
Step 11: However, without the specific value of 'n', we cannot solve this equation directly. We need to rely on the information that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate and the total is 22 cups.
Step 12: Given the constraints and the equations, we realize that the correct approach would involve solving the system of equations given by the total number of cups and the difference in cups. However, without the exact value of 'n', we cannot proceed further in the mathematical calculation. The correct approach would involve trial and error with the given options to see which one fits the conditions provided."

Step 8: Since 'n*r' represents the cups of hot chocolate and '5r' represents the cups of tea on rainy days, and we know the total cups, we can deduce that 'r' must be the number of rainy days we are looking for.
Step 9: However, we made a mistake in our thought process; we should have used the original equations to solve for 'r' directly. Let's correct this by focusing on the equations 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' and '5*nr - n*r = 8'.
Step 10: Substituting 'nr = 7 - r' into 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' gives us a single equation in terms of 'r'.
Step 11: However, without the specific value of 'n', we cannot solve this equation directly. We need to rely on the information that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate and the total is 22 cups.
Step 12: Given the constraints and the equations, we realize that the correct approach would involve solving the system of equations given by the total number of cups and the difference in cups. However, without the exact value of 'n', we cannot proceed further in the mathematical calculation. The correct approach would involve trial and error with the given options to see which one fits the conditions provided."

The options are: a ) 2.8 liters . , b ) 2.5 liters . , c ) 8.5 liters . , d ) 2.6 liters . , e ) 10 liters .",e,e,e,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Identify the amount of water and solid content in the tomato juice. Since the tomato juice is 90% water, it means 10% of it is solid content.
step 2: Calculate the amount of solid content in 80 liters of tomato juice. Since 10% of it is solid, 80 liters * 10% = 8 liters of solid content.
step 3: Understand that the process of boiling tomato juice into puree only removes water, so the amount of solid content remains the same.
step 4: Since the tomato puree has 20% water, it means 80% of it is solid content.
step 5: Set up an equation to find out how many liters of tomato puree will contain 8 liters of solid content, knowing that this solid content represents 80% of the total puree volume. Let x be the total volume of the puree. Therefore, 80% of x = 8 liters.
step 6: Solve the equation for x. 0.80 * x = 8 liters, which simplifies to x = 8 / 0.80.
step 7: Calculate the value of x. x = 10 liters.
step 8: Compare the calculated value of x with the given options.","step 1: Identify the amount of water and solid content in the tomato juice. Since the tomato juice is 90% water, it means 10% of it is solid content.
step 2: Calculate the amount of solid content in 80 liters of tomato juice. Since 10% of it is solid, 80 liters * 10% = 8 liters of solid content.
step 3: Understand that the process of boiling tomato juice into puree only removes water, so the amount of solid content remains the same.
Step 4: To find the total volume of the tomato puree, use the fact that the solid content remains constant at 8 liters. Since the puree is 20% water, it means that 80% of its volume is the solid content. Let x be the total volume of the puree. Therefore, 0.80x = 8 liters. Solving for x gives x = 8 / 0.80 = 10 liters.
Step 5: Realize that there was a mistake in the interpretation of the puree composition in Step 4. The correct interpretation should be that since the puree is 20% water, the remaining 80% is not the solid content but rather the total composition of the puree. This means the calculation in Step 4 is actually correct and does not need correction.
Step 6: Conclude that the total volume of the tomato puree obtained from 80 liters of tomato juice, keeping the solid content constant and considering the puree composition, is indeed 10 liters."

The options are: A) Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies., B) Postcolonialism takes account not only of major war, but also of so-called 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts., C) Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics., D) Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.",a,c,c,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","step 1: Understand that postcolonialism is a theoretical approach that seeks to address the impacts of colonialism on cultures, societies, and relations, including in the realm of security studies. It often emphasizes the perspectives and experiences of the colonized or formerly colonized peoples.
step 2: Evaluate option A, which states that postcolonialism considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies. This aligns with postcolonialism's focus on non-Western perspectives and the importance of local and indigenous contexts, making it a feature of postcolonialism rather than a distinction from other perspectives.
step 3: Consider option B, which mentions postcolonialism's attention to 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts. This is consistent with postcolonialism's broader view of security that goes beyond traditional state-centric and major war focuses, thus it is a defining feature of postcolonialism.
step 4: Look at option C, which highlights postcolonialism's focus on the role of violence in world politics. While postcolonialism does critically examine violence, including colonial violence, this focus is not unique to postcolonialism as other theories, such as realism and critical security studies, also consider the role of violence in world politics.
step 5: Review option D, which asserts that postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge. This is a key aspect of postcolonialism, as it seeks to decenter Eurocentric views and incorporate perspectives from the Global South and other marginalized voices, making it a defining feature.
