2,2,"rani bought more apples than oranges . she sells apples at ₹ 23 apiece and makes 15 % profit . she sells oranges at ₹ 10 apiece and makes 25 % profit . if she gets ₹ 653 after selling all the apples and oranges , find her profit percentage z . The options are: a ) 16.8 % , b ) 17.4 % , c ) 17.9 % , d ) 18.5 % , e ) 19.1 %",b,b,unable to determine without additional information or a different approach to calculate the total cost and number of fruits sold.,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Let's denote the cost price of an apple as 'A' and the cost price of an orange as 'O'.
step 2: Given that Rani sells apples at ₹23 apiece with a 15% profit, we can calculate the cost price of an apple. The selling price (SP) of an apple is ₹23, and the profit is 15%, so the cost price (CP) can be found using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%). Therefore, A = 23 / 1.15.
step 3: Similarly, Rani sells oranges at ₹10 apiece with a 25% profit. So, using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%), we find that O = 10 / 1.25.
step 4: Let's denote the number of apples sold by 'x' and the number of oranges sold by 'y'. The total revenue from selling all apples and oranges is ₹653, so we have the equation 23x + 10y = 653.
step 5: To find the profit percentage, we first need to calculate the total cost price (TCP) and the total selling price (TSP). TCP = Ax + Oy, and TSP = 653.
step 6: However, we don't have enough information to directly solve for 'x' and 'y'. Instead, we focus on calculating the total cost and then the profit percentage. The profit is given by Profit = TSP - TCP.
step 7: Calculate A and O from steps 2 and 3. A = 23 / 1.15 = 20, O = 10 / 1.25 = 8.
step 8: Since we cannot directly calculate 'x' and 'y', we focus on the profit percentage formula, which is Profit% = (Profit / TCP) * 100. We know TSP = 653, but we need to find a way to estimate TCP and then calculate the profit.
step 9: The challenge here is that without the exact numbers of apples and oranges sold, we cannot directly calculate TCP or the profit. However, we can infer that the profit percentage must be calculated based on the given options and the understanding that the profit percentage is a weighted average of the individual profit percentages of apples and oranges, which are 15% and 25% respectively. Since more apples were sold and their profit percentage is lower, the overall profit percentage should be closer to 15% but higher due to the contribution of oranges.
step 10: Given the options and the analysis, we can estimate that the correct option should be slightly above 15% but not exceeding the 25% mark, making option (b) 17.4% a reasonable estimate based on the given information and the constraints of the problem.","Step 1: Let's denote the cost price of an apple as 'A' and the cost price of an orange as 'O'.
Step 2: Given that Rani sells apples at ₹23 apiece with a 15% profit, we can calculate the cost price of an apple. The selling price (SP) of an apple is ₹23, and the profit is 15%, so the cost price (CP) can be found using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%). Therefore, A = 23 / 1.15.
Step 3: Similarly, Rani sells oranges at ₹10 apiece with a 25% profit. So, using the formula SP = CP * (1 + profit%), we find that O = 10 / 1.25.
Step 4: Let's denote the number of apples sold by 'x' and the number of oranges sold by 'y'. The total revenue from selling all apples and oranges is ₹653, so we have the equation (23x + 10y = 653) for revenue. However, to find the profit percentage, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue correctly using the cost prices of apples and oranges calculated in steps 2 and 3. The correct approach for this step would involve using the cost prices 'A' and 'O' for calculating total cost, not for setting up the revenue equation directly.
Step 5: Calculate the cost price of an apple using the formula from Step 2: A = 23 / 1.15 = ₹20.
Step 6: Calculate the cost price of an orange using the formula from Step 3: O = 10 / 1.25 = ₹8.
Step 7: The total cost can be calculated as the sum of the cost of all apples and oranges sold, which is (20x + 8y).
Step 8: The total revenue is given as ₹653. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 653 - (20x + 8y).
Step 9: To find the profit percentage, we need to divide the profit by the total cost and then multiply by 100. The formula for profit percentage is ((653 - (20x + 8y)) / (20x + 8y)) * 100.
Step 10: However, without the exact numbers of apples (x) and oranges (y) sold, we cannot directly calculate the profit percentage. We need to either find x and y from additional information or use a different approach to solve the problem.
Step 11: Since the problem does not provide enough information to solve for x and y directly, and our goal is to find the overall profit percentage, we should focus on calculating the total cost and total profit directly from the given total revenue and the cost prices of apples and oranges.
Step 12: The correct approach to find the profit percentage 'z' would involve calculating the total cost of all fruits sold and then using the total revenue of ₹653 to find the total profit. From there, we can calculate the profit percentage. However, without additional information or a different method to calculate the total cost and number of fruits sold, we cannot proceed further to find the exact profit percentage 'z'."

step 2: Identify the number of applicants who majored in political science, which is 15.
step 3: Identify the number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0, which is 20.
step 4: Identify the number of applicants who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 10.
step 5: Calculate the number of applicants who did not major in political science, which is 40 (total applicants) - 15 (majored in political science) = 25.
step 6: Calculate the number of applicants with a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 40 (total applicants) - 20 (GPA higher than 3.0) = 20.
step 7: Since 10 applicants did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, subtract this from the totals calculated in steps 5 and 6 to find the overlap in the remaining groups.
step 8: Calculate the number of applicants who majored in political science and had a GPA higher than 3.0. Since there are 15 applicants who majored in political science and 20 with a GPA higher than 3.0, and knowing that 10 are outside these groups, we can find the intersection by adding the counts of political science majors and high GPA applicants (15 + 20) and subtracting the non-overlapping group (10) and the total applicants (40) to avoid double counting. However, this approach seems incorrect upon review because it does not directly address the overlap between political science majors and high GPA applicants.
step 9: Correcting the approach, we realize that the direct calculation of the intersection is not straightforward from the given information. Instead, we know that out of the 25 applicants who did not major in political science, 10 had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, leaving 15 who did not major in political science but had a GPA higher than 3.0. Therefore, to find the number of political science majors with a GPA higher than 3.0, we subtract from the total number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0 those who did not major in political science but had a high GPA. This gives us 20 (applicants with GPA > 3.0) - 15 (non-political science majors with GPA > 3.0) = 5.
step 10: The correct answer is therefore 5, which corresponds to option (a).","Step 1: Identify the total number of applicants, which is 40.
Step 2: Identify the number of applicants who majored in political science, which is 15.
Step 3: Identify the number of applicants with a GPA higher than 3.0, which is 20.
Step 4: Identify the number of applicants who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 10.
Step 5: Calculate the number of applicants who did not major in political science, which is 40 (total applicants) - 15 (majored in political science) = 25.
Step 6: Calculate the number of applicants with a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0, which is 40 (total applicants) - 20 (GPA higher than 3.0) = 20.
Step 7: Calculate the number of applicants who majored in political science or had a GPA higher than 3.0. This is done by subtracting the number of applicants who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0 from the total number of applicants, which is 40 - 10 = 30.
Step 8: To find the number of applicants who majored in political science and had a GPA higher than 3.0, we subtract the sum of applicants who majored in political science and those with a GPA higher than 3.0 from the number calculated in Step 7. This accounts for the overlap between the two groups. So, we calculate 15 (political science majors) + 20 (GPA > 3.0) - 30 = 5.
Step 9: Realize there was a mistake in Step 8 calculation. The correct approach is to understand that the number calculated in Step 7 includes all except those who neither majored in political science nor had a GPA higher than 3.0. The overlap between political science majors and those with a GPA higher than 3.0 is not directly calculated in previous steps.
Step 10: Correct the approach by understanding that the total number of applicants minus those who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0 gives us the number of applicants who either majored in political science or had a GPA higher than 3.0, or both. Since we already know the number of applicants who did not major in political science and had a GPA equal to or lower than 3.0 is 10, and the total is 40, we have 30 applicants who are either political science majors or have a GPA higher than 3.0, or both. However, this does not directly answer the question.
Step 11: Since we need to find those who both majored in political science and had a GPA higher than 3.0, we look at the overlap within the 30 applicants identified in Step 10. Given the information provided, we cannot directly calculate this overlap without making assumptions.
Step 12: Recognize that the calculation in Step 8 was incorrect and that without additional information or a clearer method to calculate the direct overlap, we cannot accurately determine the number of applicants who majored in political science and had a GPA higher than 3.0 based on the information provided and the steps taken."

step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:12 or simplified to 1:4.
step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half the standard, making it 1:60.
step 4: Since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation is 1:4, and there are 3 ounces of corn syrup, it means there is 3/4 ounces of flavoring (because for every 4 parts of corn syrup, there is 1 part of flavoring).
step 5: Knowing there is 3/4 ounces of flavoring and the ratio of flavoring to water is 1:60, calculate the amount of water. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 60 parts of water. Therefore, for 3/4 parts of flavoring, there would be (3/4)*60 parts of water.
step 6: Perform the calculation from step 5: (3/4)*60 = 45.
step 7: Conclude that the large bottle of the 'sport' formulation contains 45 ounces of water.","step 1: Identify the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water in the standard formulation, which is 1:12:30.
step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:12 or simplified to 1:4.
Step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half the standard, making it 1:15. *<verified>*
Step 4: Combine the ratios for the sport formulation to get the overall ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water, which is 1:4:15.
Step 5: Since the sport formulation contains 3 ounces of corn syrup and the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:4, calculate the amount of flavoring. For every 4 parts of corn syrup, there is 1 part of flavoring, so there is 3/4 = 0.75 ounces of flavoring.
Step 6: Use the ratio of flavoring to water (1:15) to find the amount of water. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 15 parts of water.
Step 7: Since there are 0.75 ounces of flavoring, multiply this by 15 to find the amount of water. 0.75 * 15 = 11.25 ounces of water for every 0.75 ounces of flavoring.
Step 8: Realize there's a mistake in Step 7 calculation due to misunderstanding the combined ratio. Correctly, for every 1 part of flavoring, there are 4 parts of corn syrup and 15 parts of water. Given 3 ounces of corn syrup corresponds to 4 parts in the ratio, the calculation should directly relate to the amount of water through the ratio without needing to find the amount of flavoring first.
Step 9: Since the ratio of corn syrup to water is 4:15, and we have 3 ounces of corn syrup, we find the equivalent in water by setting up a proportion. If 4 parts (corn syrup) is to 3 ounces, then 15 parts (water) is to X ounces.
Step 10: Solve the proportion 4/3 = 15/X. Cross multiply to get 4X = 45.
Step 11: Solve for X by dividing both sides by 4. X = 45 / 4 = 11.25.
Step 12: Realize the mistake in the calculation process from Step 9 onwards, as the correct approach should directly scale the entire ratio based on the given amount of corn syrup. The correct calculation should consider the total parts of the ratio (1+4+15=20 parts) and how 3 ounces of corn syrup (4 parts) scales to the total. The error in steps 9-11 indicates a misunderstanding of the ratio's application to the quantities involved."
