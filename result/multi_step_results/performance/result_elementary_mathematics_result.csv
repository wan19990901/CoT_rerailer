0,0,professional_accounting,"Which of the following items is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation? The options are: A) Discontinued operations, B) Income from continuing operations., C) Extraordinary gains and losses, D) Operating income.",d,b,d,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","Step 1: Understand what intraperiod tax allocation involves. Intraperiod tax allocation is an accounting method used to allocate income taxes within a single fiscal period among different items that appear on the income statement. This method ensures that each item reflects its own tax effects, making the financial statements more accurate and meaningful.
Step 2: Identify the items typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. Generally, intraperiod tax allocation is applied to items that are unusual or infrequent, such as discontinued operations and extraordinary items. This is because these items can significantly affect the tax expense reported on the income statement, and allocating taxes to these items separately helps in presenting a clearer picture of the company's financial performance.
Step 3: Evaluate the options given in the question. A) Discontinued operations are typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they represent a significant event that is separate from the company's ongoing operations. B) Income from continuing operations is the baseline for calculating income taxes and is not 'allocated' taxes in the same way as specific, unusual, or infrequent items. C) Extraordinary gains and losses, under the guidelines that used to define them, were subject to intraperiod tax allocation due to their unusual nature and infrequency. However, it's worth noting that the accounting standards have evolved, and the concept of 'extraordinary items' has been eliminated under U.S. GAAP, but the principle of allocating taxes to significant, unusual, or infrequent items remains. D) Operating income is part of income from continuing operations and does not get separately allocated income taxes for intraperiod purposes.
Step 4: Based on the analysis, the item that is not subject to the application of intraperiod income tax allocation is the income from continuing operations, as it represents the baseline activity of the company and does not get separately allocated income taxes in the context of intraperiod tax allocation.","Step 1: Understand what intraperiod tax allocation involves. Intraperiod tax allocation is an accounting method used to allocate income taxes within a single fiscal period among different items that appear on the income statement. This method ensures that each item reflects its own tax effects, making the financial statements more accurate and meaningful. *<verified>*
Step 2: Identify the items typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. Intraperiod tax allocation is applied not only to items that are unusual or infrequent, such as discontinued operations and extraordinary items, but also to regular items like income from continuing operations. This approach ensures that the tax expense reported on the income statement accurately reflects the tax effects associated with each item, thereby presenting a clearer picture of the company's financial performance. *<verified>*
Step 3: Recall the definition of operating income. Operating income is the profit realized from a business's core operations, indicating the amount of revenue left after deducting the operational direct and indirect costs. Operating income does not include items like discontinued operations, extraordinary items, or other non-operating incomes and expenses.
Step 4: Analyze the options in relation to intraperiod tax allocation. Given the understanding of intraperiod tax allocation, it's clear that it is applied to items that significantly impact the financial statements due to their unusual nature or because they represent the core operations of the business.
Step 5: Determine which item is not typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. Since operating income is a measure of the core business activities and does not include unusual or infrequent items, it is generally not broken down further for the purpose of intraperiod tax allocation. The tax effects related to operating income are typically considered within the broader category of income from continuing operations.
Step 6: Conclude that the item not subject to intraperiod tax allocation among the options provided is operating income."
1,1,professional_accounting,"Johnson worked for ABC Co. and earned a salary of $100,000. Johnson also received, as a fringe benefit, group termlife insurance at twice Johnsonâ€™s salary. The annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance is $2.76 per $1,000. What amount must Johnson include in gross income?

So, 2 * $100,000 = $200,000.
step 2: Calculate the cost of this insurance per $1,000 of coverage. The IRS established uniform cost is $2.76 per $1,000.
step 3: Determine how many thousands of dollars worth of insurance Johnson has. $200,000 / $1,000 = 200.
step 4: Multiply the number of thousands of dollars worth of insurance by the cost per $1,000 to find the total cost of the insurance. 200 * $2.76 = $552.
step 5: Since the first $50,000 of employer-provided group term life insurance is excluded from gross income under IRS rules, only the cost of insurance over this amount is taxable. Johnson has $200,000 of coverage, so $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000 is the amount over the exclusion.
step 6: Calculate the taxable cost of the insurance over the exclusion. Since we already calculated the total cost of the insurance for $200,000 of coverage to be $552, we need to calculate the cost for the first $50,000 and subtract it from $552 to find the taxable amount. The cost for $50,000 of coverage is ($50,000 / $1,000) * $2.76 = 50 * $2.76 = $138.

step 2: Understand that liabilities for utilities are recognized when the service period has ended but the payment has not yet been made.
step 3: Identify the utility bills that are relevant for the period ending June 30. These are the bills for the periods April 16 - May 15 and May 16 - June 15, because their service periods have ended by June 30, but the June 16 - July 15 period is not included because its service period ends after June 30.
step 4: Note that the bill for April 16 - May 15 ($5,000) would not be considered a liability as of June 30 because it was paid on June 1, before the balance sheet date.
step 5: Recognize that the bill for May 16 - June 15 ($6,000) has not been paid by June 30, making it a liability that should be reported on the balance sheet.

4,4,professional_accounting,"Spark Co. buys cordless phones for $125 each and sells them for $200 each. Spark pays a sales commission of $25 per phone sold and monthly fixed costs are $3000. Assuming Spark desired a profit of 10% of sales how many units must Spark sell? The options are: A) 600, B) 400, C) 200, D) 100",d,d,d,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","Step 1: Calculate the profit per unit by subtracting the cost per unit and the sales commission from the selling price. Profit per unit = $200 (selling price) - $125 (cost per unit) - $25 (sales commission) = $50.
Step 2: Calculate the desired total profit by applying the desired profit percentage to the total sales. Desired profit = 10% of sales. However, we need to calculate the number of units first to determine total sales, so we'll incorporate this in a later step.
Step 3: Set up the equation to solve for the number of units (N) needed to meet the desired profit, incorporating fixed costs, profit per unit, and desired profit percentage. The equation is: Total Sales = N * $200 (selling price per unit), Desired Profit = 10% of Total Sales, and Total Profit = (Profit per unit * N) + Fixed Costs.
Step 4: Realize that the step 3 equation needs correction because the desired profit is not added to fixed costs but is a part of the total profit calculation. Correct equation: Total Profit = (Profit per unit * N) - Fixed Costs, and we aim for this total profit to be 10% of Total Sales.
Step 5: Since we know the desired profit is 10% of Total Sales, we can express Total Sales as Total Sales = N * $200. Therefore, Desired Profit = 0.10 * (N * $200).
Step 6: Substitute the expression for Desired Profit into the Total Profit equation and solve for N. We get: 0.10 * (N * $200) = ($50 * N) - $3000.
Step 7: Simplify the equation: $20N = $50N - $3000.
Step 8: Rearrange the equation to solve for N: $30N = $3000.
Step 9: Solve for N: N = $3000 / $30 = 100.","Step 1: Calculate the profit per unit by subtracting the cost per unit and the sales commission from the selling price. Profit per unit = $200 (selling price) - $125 (cost per unit) - $25 (sales commission) = $50. *<verified>*
Step 2: To calculate the number of units needed to be sold to achieve a 10% profit of sales, we need to ensure that the net profit (profit per unit * number of units sold - fixed costs) is 10% of the total sales (selling price per unit * number of units sold). Given that the profit per unit is $50, and the fixed costs are $3000, we set up the equation as follows: ((50x - 3000) / (200x)) = 0.10, where 'x' is the number of units sold. This equation correctly represents the relationship needed to find the number of units that satisfies a 10% profit margin on sales. *<verified>*
Step 3: Simplify the equation to solve for 'x'. Start by multiplying both sides by 200x to get rid of the denominator: (50x - 3000) = 0.10 * 200x. Correctly applying the multiplication leads to 50x - 3000 = 20x. To solve for 'x', the equation should be further simplified correctly. *<verified>*
Step 4: Correct the error in the multiplication step. The correct equation after multiplying both sides by 200x should be 50x - 3000 = 20x. This is incorrect. The correct step should be multiplying 20x by 0.10, which gives 20x. Therefore, the correct equation is 50x - 3000 = 20x. *<verified>*
Step 5: Realize the mistake in Step 4 explanation. The correct equation after distributing 0.10 to 200x is actually 50x - 3000 = 20x * 0.10, which simplifies to 50x - 3000 = 20x. This step was mistakenly explained; the correct simplification should lead to 50x - 3000 = 20x. *<verified>*
Step 6: Correctly simplify the equation from Step 3, which should be 50x - 3000 = 20x. The correct step is to subtract 20x from both sides to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. This leads to 30x - 3000 = 0. *<verified>*
Step 7: Add 3000 to both sides of the equation to further isolate x, resulting in 30x = 3000. *<verified>*
Step 8: Divide both sides of the equation by 30 to solve for x, which gives x = 100. *<verified>*
Step 9: Conclude that Spark Co. must sell 100 units to achieve a 10% profit of sales. *<verified>*"

Since the stock was a gift, the basis for the child is the same as the donor's basis, which is $40,000.
step 2: Determine the fair market value (FMV) at the time of the gift. The FMV is $30,000.
step 3: Identify the selling price of the stock, which is $36,000.
step 4: Determine if the sale results in a gain or loss. Since the selling price ($36,000) is less than the basis ($40,000), this would typically indicate a loss. However, for gifted property, special rules apply.
step 5: For determining gain, use the donor's basis ($40,000). Since the selling price ($36,000) is less than the donor's basis, but more than the FMV at the time of the gift, the difference between the selling price and the donor's basis is a loss. However, this loss is not recognized because it falls within the range of the FMV at the time of the gift and the donor's basis.
step 6: For determining loss, if the selling price had been below the FMV at the time of the gift ($30,000), then the basis for loss would be the FMV at the time of the gift. Since the selling price ($36,000) is above the FMV, no loss is recognized.

Step 6: To confirm the recognized gain, it's important to remember that for tax purposes, the gain recognized on the sale of gifted stock is calculated by comparing the selling price to the donor's basis if the sale results in a gain. However, since the selling price ($36,000) is less than the donor's basis ($40,000), this would typically indicate a loss. But, because the selling price is above the FMV and tax rules do not allow recognizing a loss when the selling price is between the donor's basis and the FMV, there is no recognized gain or loss in this scenario. *<verified>*
Step 7: Re-evaluate the conclusion in Step 6. The correct interpretation of tax rules for gifted property is that the gain should be calculated by comparing the selling price to the donor's basis if the sale results in a gain, which is correct. However, the analysis in Step 6 incorrectly concludes there is no recognized gain or loss. The correct approach is to recognize a gain when the selling price is above the FMV at the time of the gift. *<verified>*
Step 8: Correct the analysis. Since the selling price is above the FMV, the recognized gain should be calculated as the difference between the selling price ($36,000) and the FMV ($30,000), resulting in a $6,000 gain. This is consistent with the tax rules for gifted property, where the gain is recognized when the selling price exceeds the FMV at the time of the gift. *<verified>*"

This means we need to calculate the estimated returns for the current month's sales, which is 5% of $200,000 ($10,000), and subtract that from the total sales to get the net sales revenue for new sales, which would be $200,000 - $10,000 = $190,000. *<verified>*
Step 2: Identify the returns from prior months. The company has returns of sales made in prior months amounting to $5,000. This amount is separate from the current month's sales and estimated returns. *<verified>*
Step 3: Calculate the net sales revenue for the month. Since the returns from prior months ($5,000) do not affect the calculation of net sales revenue for new sales made during the current month, we only need to consider the estimated returns for the current month's sales. Therefore, the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month remains $190,000, as calculated in Step 1. *<verified>*
Step 4: Finalize the net sales revenue figure. The net sales revenue for new sales made during the month, after accounting for estimated returns but not including returns from prior months, is $190,000. This is because the question specifically asks for the net sales revenue for new sales made during the month, which we have calculated by subtracting the estimated returns for the current month's sales from the total sales. *<verified>*"

Step 2: Consider the $4,000 check payable to Rune. Since it is postdated January 3 and not included in the December 31 checkbook balance, it should not be considered in the December 31 balance sheet. It represents a future receipt of cash, not current cash.
Step 3: Examine the $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance but was returned by the bank on December 30 stamped 'NSF' (Non-Sufficient Funds). Since this check was included in the balance but then bounced, it means the actual cash balance was overstated by $1,000.
Step 4: Subtract the $1,000 from the initial balance to adjust for the NSF check. This is because the NSF check was included in the balance, but since it bounced, the actual cash available is less by that amount.
Step 5: Calculate the adjusted cash balance by subtracting $1,000 from the initial $10,000 balance, which gives us $9,000.

The payback period is the time it takes for an investment to generate an amount of income or cash equal to the cost of the investment. 
Step 2: Calculate the net annual cash inflow from the machine. This is done by subtracting the annual operating expenses from the annual revenues. Annual revenues are $35,000 and annual operating expenses are $7,000, so net annual cash inflow = $35,000 - $7,000 = $28,000. 
Step 3: Note that depreciation is a non-cash expense and has already been included in the operating expenses. However, for the purpose of calculating cash flows for the payback period, we need to add back the depreciation expense to the net annual cash inflow since it does not reduce the actual cash flow. So, adjusted net annual cash inflow = $28,000 + $4,000 = $32,000. 
Step 4: Use the payback period formula to find the initial investment. The formula is: Initial Investment = Net Annual Cash Inflow x Payback Period. Here, the payback period is 5.2 years, so Initial Investment = $32,000 x 5.2.

Intraperiod income tax allocation involves allocating income taxes within a single fiscal period among different components of net income and other comprehensive income. This is done to show the tax effect of each component separately, providing a clearer picture of a company's financial performance.
Step 2: Identify the components typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation. These components usually include items that are unusual or infrequent, such as discontinued operations and extraordinary items, because showing their tax effects separately helps users of financial statements understand their impact on the overall tax expense.
Step 3: Analyze each option in the context of intraperiod tax allocation. A) Discontinued operations are typically subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they are significant, infrequent, or unusual events. B) Income from continuing operations is the baseline for calculating income taxes but is not separately allocated for tax purposes within the period; rather, it's the aggregate income that tax is calculated on. C) Extraordinary gains and losses, under accounting standards that recognize them, would be subject to intraperiod tax allocation because they are unusual and infrequent. However, it's worth noting that many accounting standards, including U.S. GAAP, have moved away from categorizing items as extraordinary. D) Operating income is a component of income from continuing operations and does not get separately allocated for tax purposes within the period.
