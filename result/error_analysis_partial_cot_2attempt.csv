0,0,"miller street begins at baker street and runs directly east for 4.5 kilometers until it ends when it meets turner street . miller street is intersected every 250 meters by a perpendicular street , and each of those streets other than baker street and turner street is given a number beginning at 1 st street ( one block east of baker street ) and continuing consecutively ( 2 nd street , 3 rd street , etc . . . ) until the highest - numbered street one block west of turner street . what is the highest - numbered street that intersects miller street ? The options are: a ) 15 th , b ) 16 th , c ) 17 th , d ) 18 th , e ) 19 th",c,C,c) 17th,"['NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Identify the total length of Miller Street, which is 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
step 3: Calculate the number of sections created by these intersections. Since the first and last streets (Baker and Turner) are not numbered and the streets are 250 meters apart, divide the total length by the distance between intersections: 4500 meters / 250 meters = 18.
step 4: Realize that the calculation in step 3 gives the total number of sections, but since Baker and Turner streets are not numbered, the highest numbered street will be one less than the total number of sections.
step 5: Subtract 1 from the total number of sections to find the highest numbered street: 18 - 1 = 17.","Step 1: Identify the total length of Miller Street, which is 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
Step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
Step 3: Calculate the highest-numbered street by subtracting one from the total number of sections, as the first and last sections do not have numbered streets. The correct calculation is 4500 meters / 250 meters - 1 = 17.
Step 4: The calculation in Step 3 correctly identifies the number of sections that would have numbered streets. Since the calculation is (total length / distance between streets) - 1, it accounts for the initial section (from Baker Street to 1st Street) and the final section (from the last numbered street to Turner Street), which do not receive numbers.
Step 5: Therefore, the highest-numbered street that intersects Miller Street would be the 17th Street, as calculated in Step 3, considering the subtraction accounts for the unnumbered sections at the beginning and end of Miller Street.
Step 6: No further calculations are needed as the previous steps accurately determine the highest-numbered street based on the given information and the logical deduction applied."
1,1,"a bucket contains 2 mixtures a and b in the ratio 3 : 2 . if 5 liters of the mixture is replaced by 5 liters of liquid b , then the ratio of the two liquids becomes 3 : 5 . how much of the liquid a was there in the bucket ? The options are: a ) 8 liters , b ) 10 liters , c ) 12 liters , d ) 15 liters , e ) 18 liters",a,d,a,"['NO', 'NO', 'YES']","step 1: Let the initial quantities of mixtures A and B be 3x and 2x liters respectively, since the ratio is 3:2.
step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantity of A and B taken out will be in the same ratio of 3:2. So, 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B are taken out if we consider the 5 liters as being proportionate to the original ratio.
step 4: However, this step is incorrect because we don't know the exact amount of A and B taken out without knowing x. We should instead calculate the effect of adding 5 liters of B directly.
step 5: After removing 5 liters of the mixture, we add 5 liters of B, so the amount of B increases by 5 liters.
step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Let's denote the new quantities of A and B as A' and B' respectively.
step 7: Since the quantity of A does not change when B is added, A' = 3x.
step 8: The new quantity of B, B' = 2x + 5.
step 9: The new ratio 3:5 can be represented as A'/B' = 3/5. Substituting A' and B' gives 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5.
step 10: Solving the equation 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5 gives x = 5. Therefore, the initial quantity of A was 3x = 3*5 = 15 liters.","Step 1: Let the initial quantities of mixtures A and B be 3x and 2x liters respectively, since the ratio is 3:2.
Step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
Step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantities of A and B taken out will still be in the ratio of 3:2. However, it is crucial to understand that this action, followed by replacing 5 liters with liquid B, alters the ratio of A to B in the bucket. The focus should be on how this removal and replacement process changes the ratio to 3:5, rather than on the specific amounts of A and B removed. The next steps should involve adjusting the ratio after this process to solve for 'x' and determine the initial amount of liquid A in the bucket.
Step 4: Since the mixture is taken out in the ratio of 3:2, out of the 5 liters removed, 3 parts would be A and 2 parts would be B. Therefore, 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B are removed.
Step 5: After removal, the quantity of A becomes (3x - 3) liters and the quantity of B becomes (2x - 2 + 5) liters, because we add 5 liters of B back into the bucket.
Step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Therefore, (3x - 3)/(2x + 3) = 3/5.
Step 7: Cross-multiplying gives 15x - 15 = 6x + 9.
Step 8: Solving for x, we get 15x - 6x = 9 + 15, which simplifies to 9x = 24.
Step 9: Solving for x, x = 24 / 9 = 8 / 3.
Step 10: The initial quantity of A is 3x, so substituting x = 8 / 3 gives us 3 * (8 / 3) = 8 liters.
Step 11: Therefore, the initial amount of liquid A in the bucket was 8 liters.
Step 12: Comparing with the given options, the correct answer is option (a) 8 liters."

step 3: Identify the pattern in the sequence. The sequence alternates between squares and cubes: square (9^2), cube (4^3), cube (3^3), square (4^2).
step 4: Recognize that the sequence is decreasing and alternates between the square of a number and the cube of a smaller number.
step 5: Predict the next term in the sequence. Since the last number given is 16 (4^2), the next number should be a cube.
step 6: Determine the next smaller cube after 27 (3^3), which is 8 (2^3).
step 7: Realize that step 6 was incorrect in predicting the pattern, as the sequence actually follows a pattern of decreasing perfect squares and cubes without repeating the base number. The correct next step is to find the square or cube smaller than 16 (4^2) that follows the pattern.
step 8: Since the pattern involves decreasing numbers and the last number is a square, the next number should be a cube smaller than 16. The cube smaller than 16 is 8 (2^3), but it does not fit the alternating pattern correctly. The correct observation is that after 16 (4^2), we should look for a square smaller than 16, which is 9 (3^2), but 9 does not fit as it breaks the sequence of unique bases. The correct approach is to recognize the mistake in the pattern analysis and correctly identify that after 16, the sequence should logically continue with a smaller number that fits the observed pattern of squares and cubes. The correct next term, following the corrected understanding of the pattern, is actually 1 (1^1 or 1^2 or 1^3), as it is the next perfect power (square or cube) that follows the descending order.

The sequence does not strictly alternate between squares and cubes in a manner that decreases the base number by one each time. Instead, it follows a pattern of decreasing numbers that are either squares or cubes. The correct approach to identifying the next number involves recognizing this pattern without the incorrect assumption of a uniform decrease in base numbers.

step 2: Recall Euler's theorem, which states that for any integer a coprime with n, a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n), where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. However, since 2 and 9 are not coprime (they share a common factor, which is 1), we cannot directly apply Euler's theorem.
step 3: Notice that we can simplify the problem by finding a pattern in the powers of 2 modulo 9. Start by calculating the first few powers of 2 mod 9: 2^1 mod 9 = 2, 2^2 mod 9 = 4, 2^3 mod 9 = 8, 2^4 mod 9 = 7, 2^5 mod 9 = 5, 2^6 mod 9 = 1, and then it repeats.
step 4: Observe that the powers of 2 modulo 9 cycle every 6 steps: 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1.

step 2: The man sells the article at a profit of 25%, so the selling price is x + 25% of x = 1.25x.
step 3: If he had bought it at 20% less, the new cost price would be x - 20% of x = 0.8x.
step 4: He would have sold it for Rs. 14.70 less, so the new selling price is 1.25x - 14.70.
step 5: At this new selling price, he would have gained 30%, so the new selling price is 0.8x + 30% of 0.8x = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 6: Equate the two expressions for the new selling price: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 7: Simplify the equation: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.04x.
step 8: Subtract 1.04x from both sides: 0.21x = 14.70.
step 9: Solve for x: x = 14.70 / 0.21 = 70.","Step 1: Let the original cost price of the article be 'x'.

Step 4: To find the new selling price based on a 30% profit on the new cost price (0.8x), we calculate 1.30 * 0.8x. To incorporate the condition that he sold it for Rs. 14.70 less, we need to correctly establish the relationship between the new and old selling prices. This involves calculating the original selling price with a 25% profit (1.25x) and the new selling price with a 30% profit on the reduced cost price (1.30 * 0.8x), and then using the information that the new selling price is Rs. 14.70 less than the original to find 'x'.

Please review the equations and calculation steps.","['NO', 'YES']","step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
step 2: Since Mo drinks n cups of hot chocolate on rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate drunk in a week is 'n*r'.
step 3: On non-rainy days, Mo drinks exactly 5 cups of tea, so the total cups of tea drunk in a week is '5*nr'.
step 4: We are given that Mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together, which gives us the equation: n*r + 5*nr = 22.
step 5: We are also given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, which gives us the equation: 5*nr = n*r + 8.
step 6: Since there are 7 days in a week, we have another equation: r + nr = 7.
step 7: From step 5, we can simplify to nr = r + 8/5, but since nr and r must be integers, this equation seems incorrect in the context. Correcting the interpretation: the correct equation from the given information is 5*nr - n*r = 8.
step 8: Substituting nr = 7 - r into the equation from step 7 gives us 5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8. However, realizing the mistake in step 7, we should directly use the information to solve the problem without misinterpreting the equations.
step 9: Correct approach: Let's use the information directly. Total drinks = 22, and tea cups are 8 more than hot chocolate cups. If we let 't' be the number of tea cups and 'h' be the number of hot chocolate cups, we have t + h = 22 and t = h + 8. Solving these equations gives us t = 15 and h = 7. Since Mo drinks 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, nr = 15/5 = 3. Therefore, r = 7 - 3 = 4 rainy days.
step 10: Correcting the mistake in step 7 and following the correct approach in step 9 leads us to the correct number of rainy days.","Step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
Step 2: Let's denote the total number of days as 'd'. Since there are 'r' rainy days and 'nr' non-rainy days, and Mo drinks 'n' cups of hot chocolate on rainy days and 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate and tea drunk in a week can be represented as 'n*r + 5*nr'. Given that Mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together and that there were 8 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups, we need to set up equations that reflect these conditions.
Step 3: Since the total number of cups is 22, we have the equation 'n*r + 5*nr = 22'.
Step 4: Given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, we can set up another equation '5*nr - n*r = 8'.
Step 5: We know that a week has 7 days, so 'r + nr = 7'. This gives us the total number of days in the week.
Step 6: From Step 5, we can express 'nr' as '7 - r'.
Step 7: Substituting 'nr' from Step 6 into the equations from Steps 3 and 4, we get 'n*r + 5*(7 - r) = 22' and '5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8'.
Step 8: Simplifying the equations, we get 'n*r + 35 - 5*r = 22' and '35 - 5*r - n*r = 8'.
Step 9: Simplifying further, we get '-n*r + 5*r = 13' and '-n*r - 5*r = -27'.
Step 10: Since we have two equations with the terms involving 'n' and 'r', we need to find a consistent solution that satisfies both the total cups condition and the difference in cups condition. However, there seems to be a mistake in the simplification process in Steps 8 and 9. Let's correct this approach.
Step 11: Correcting the approach, we substitute 'nr = 7 - r' into 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' to get 'n*r + 5*(7 - r) = 22', which simplifies to 'n*r + 35 - 5*r = 22', leading to 'n*r - 5*r = -13'. Similarly, for the equation '5*nr - n*r = 8', substituting 'nr' gives '5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8', which simplifies correctly to '35 - 5*r - n*r = 8'. Realizing the mistake in the simplification, we should instead focus on the fact that there are 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate and a total of 22 cups. This means if 't' represents the number of tea cups and 'h' represents the number of hot chocolate cups, then 't = h + 8' and 't + h = 22'.
Step 12: Solving 't = h + 8' and 't + h = 22' gives us 'h + 8 + h = 22', leading to '2h = 14', and thus 'h = 7'. Since 'h' represents the number of hot chocolate cups and Mo drinks hot chocolate only on rainy days, and assuming Mo drinks 1 cup of hot chocolate per rainy day, there were 7 rainy days, which contradicts the initial setup that there were 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate. The correct approach should involve correctly solving the equations to find 'r' and 'nr', and it appears there was a misunderstanding in the calculation process. The correct steps should involve re-evaluating the equations with the correct variables and conditions in mind."

step 10: Simplify the expression for average speed and solve for the value, which gives 2D / (D*(1/5.5 + 1/8.5)) = 2 / (1/5.5 + 1/8.5) = 2 / ((8.5 + 5.5) / (5.5*8.5)) = 2 / (14 / 46.75) = 2 * (46.75 / 14) = 93.5 / 14 = 6.67857142857 kmph.","Step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
Step 2: Let's denote the total number of days as 'd'. Since there are 'r' rainy days and 'nr' non-rainy days, and Mo drinks 'n' cups of hot chocolate on rainy days and 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate and tea drunk in a week can be represented as 'n*r + 5*nr'. Given that Mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together and that there were 8 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups, we need to set up equations that reflect these conditions.
Step 3: Since the total number of cups is 22, we have the equation 'n*r + 5*nr = 22'.
Step 4: Given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, we can set up another equation '5*nr - n*r = 8'.
Step 5: We know that a week has 7 days, so 'r + nr = 7'. This gives us the total number of days in the week.
Step 6: From Step 5, we can express 'nr' as '7 - r'.
Step 7: Substituting 'nr' from Step 6 into the equations from Steps 3 and 4, we get 'n*r + 5*(7 - r) = 22' and '5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8'.
Step 8: Simplifying the equations, we get 'n*r + 35 - 5*r = 22' and '35 - 5*r - n*r = 8'.
Step 9: Simplifying further, we get '-n*r + 5*r = 13' and '-n*r - 5*r = -27'.
Step 10: Since we have two equations with the terms involving 'n' and 'r', we need to find a consistent solution that satisfies both the total cups condition and the difference in cups condition. However, there seems to be a mistake in the simplification process in Steps 8 and 9. Let's correct this approach.
Step 11: Correcting the approach, we substitute 'nr = 7 - r' into 'n*r + 5*nr = 22' to get 'n*r + 5*(7 - r) = 22', which simplifies to 'n*r + 35 - 5*r = 22', leading to 'n*r - 5*r = -13'. Similarly, for the equation '5*nr - n*r = 8', substituting 'nr' gives '5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8', which simplifies correctly to '35 - 5*r - n*r = 8'. Realizing the mistake in the simplification, we should instead focus on the fact that there are 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate and a total of 22 cups. This means if 't' represents the number of tea cups and 'h' represents the number of hot chocolate cups, then 't = h + 8' and 't + h = 22'.
Step 12: Solving 't = h + 8' and 't + h = 22' gives us 'h + 8 + h = 22', leading to '2h = 14', and thus 'h = 7'. Since 'h' represents the number of hot chocolate cups and Mo drinks hot chocolate only on rainy days, and assuming Mo drinks 1 cup of hot chocolate per rainy day, there were 7 rainy days, which contradicts the initial setup that there were 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate. The correct approach should involve correctly solving the equations to find 'r' and 'nr', and it appears there was a misunderstanding in the calculation process. The correct steps should involve re-evaluating the equations with the correct variables and conditions in mind."

The options are: A) Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies., B) Postcolonialism takes account not only of major war, but also of so-called 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts., C) Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics., D) Postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge.",A,C,C,"['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO']","step 1: Understand that postcolonialism is a theoretical approach that seeks to address the impacts of colonialism on cultures, societies, and relations, including in the realm of security studies. It often emphasizes the perspectives and experiences of the colonized or formerly colonized peoples.
step 2: Evaluate option A, which states that postcolonialism considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies. This aligns with postcolonialism's focus on non-Western perspectives and the importance of local and indigenous contexts, making it a feature of postcolonialism rather than a distinction from other perspectives.
step 3: Consider option B, which mentions postcolonialism's attention to 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts. This is consistent with postcolonialism's broader view of security that goes beyond traditional state-centric and major war focuses, thus it is a defining feature of postcolonialism.
step 4: Look at option C, which highlights postcolonialism's focus on the role of violence in world politics. While postcolonialism does critically examine violence, including colonial violence, this focus is not unique to postcolonialism as other theories, such as realism and critical security studies, also consider the role of violence in world politics.
