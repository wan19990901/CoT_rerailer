Faithfulness: This type of error refers to the divergence of my step analysis from the original question or \n        previous steps, as well as self-consistency within my steps. In mathematics for instance, it may represents that\n        I understood the question wrongly or my proposed step is inconsistent with my previous step. \n\n        Other agents had helped me identify the error I made in the current step.
