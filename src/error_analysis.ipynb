      "Step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:36. This simplifies to 1:12, not 1:4 as previously stated. *<verified>*\n",
      "Step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half that of the standard formulation. The standard ratio is 1:30, so the new ratio is 1:15.\n",
      "Step 4: Combine the new ratios to get the complete ratio for the sport formulation, which is 1:12:15 for flavoring:corn syrup:water.\n",
      "Step 5: Given that there are 3 ounces of corn syrup in a large bottle of the sport formulation, and the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:12, we can determine that there is 1/4 ounce of flavoring (since 3 ounces of corn syrup corresponds to 1/12 of the total ratio for corn syrup).\n",
      "Step 6: To find the amount of water, we use the ratio of flavoring to water, which is 1:15. Since there is 1/4 ounce of flavoring, we multiply 1/4 by 15 to find the amount of water.\n",
      "Step 7: Multiplying 1/4 by 15 gives 15/4 ounces of water, which simplifies to 3.75 ounces.\n",
      "Step 8: Realize there was a mistake in Step 5 regarding the calculation of flavoring amount based on the ratio of corn syrup. The correct approach is to recognize that if the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:12, and there are 3 ounces of corn syrup, then for every 12 ounces of corn syrup, there is 1 ounce of flavoring. Therefore, the bottle contains 1/4 ounce of flavoring.\n",
      "Step 9: Correcting the mistake, since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is correctly applied, we should directly use the ratio of corn syrup to water (12:15) to find the amount of water, given the amount of corn syrup.\n",
      "Step 10: Since the ratio of corn syrup to water is 12:15, and we have 3 ounces of corn syrup, we calculate the amount of water by setting up a proportion. If 12 ounces of corn syrup correspond to 15 ounces of water, then 3 ounces of corn syrup correspond to how many ounces of water?\n",
      "Step 11: Solving the proportion (12/15 = 3/x), we find that x = (3*15)/12.\n",
      "Step 12: Calculating (3*15)/12 gives us 3.75 ounces of water, which indicates a mistake in calculation. Correct calculation should be based on the correct understanding of ratios and proportions, leading to a reevaluation of the steps to accurately determine the amount of water.\n",
      "Final Answer\n",
      "There seems to be a critical error in the calculation process, particularly in understanding how the ratios apply to the quantities of ingredients. The steps need to be carefully reviewed and corrected to accurately determine the final answer.\n",
