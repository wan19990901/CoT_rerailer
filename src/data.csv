Math,"miller street begins at baker street and runs directly east for 4.5 kilometers until it ends when it meets turner street . miller street is intersected every 250 meters by a perpendicular street , and each of those streets other than baker street and turner street is given a number beginning at 1 st street ( one block east of baker street ) and continuing consecutively ( 2 nd street , 3 rd street , etc . . . ) until the highest - numbered street one block west of turner street . what is the highest - numbered street that intersects miller street ? The options are: a ) 15 th , b ) 16 th , c ) 17 th , d ) 18 th , e ) 19 th",c,C,False,"step 1: Identify the total length of Miller Street, which is 4.5 kilometers or 4500 meters.
step 2: Determine the distance between each intersecting street, which is 250 meters.
step 3: Calculate the number of sections created by these intersections. Since the first and last streets (Baker and Turner) are not numbered and the streets are 250 meters apart, divide the total length by the distance between intersections: 4500 meters / 250 meters = 18.
step 4: Realize that the calculation in step 3 gives the total number of sections, but since Baker and Turner streets are not numbered, the highest numbered street will be one less than the total number of sections.
step 5: Subtract 1 from the total number of sections to find the highest numbered street: 18 - 1 = 17.",b

Math,"a bucket contains 2 mixtures a and b in the ratio 3 : 2 . if 5 liters of the mixture is replaced by 5 liters of liquid b , then the ratio of the two liquids becomes 3 : 5 . how much of the liquid a was there in the bucket ? The options are: a ) 8 liters , b ) 10 liters , c ) 12 liters , d ) 15 liters , e ) 18 liters",a,d,False,"step 1: Let the initial quantities of mixtures A and B be 3x and 2x liters respectively, since the ratio is 3:2.
step 2: The total initial quantity in the bucket is 3x + 2x = 5x liters.
step 3: When 5 liters of the mixture is taken out, the quantity of A and B taken out will be in the same ratio of 3:2. So, 3 liters of A and 2 liters of B are taken out if we consider the 5 liters as being proportionate to the original ratio.
step 4: However, this step is incorrect because we don't know the exact amount of A and B taken out without knowing x. We should instead calculate the effect of adding 5 liters of B directly.
step 5: After removing 5 liters of the mixture, we add 5 liters of B, so the amount of B increases by 5 liters.
step 6: The new ratio of A to B is given as 3:5. Let's denote the new quantities of A and B as A' and B' respectively.
step 7: Since the quantity of A does not change when B is added, A' = 3x.
step 8: The new quantity of B, B' = 2x + 5.
step 9: The new ratio 3:5 can be represented as A'/B' = 3/5. Substituting A' and B' gives 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5.
step 10: Solving the equation 3x / (2x + 5) = 3/5 gives x = 5. Therefore, the initial quantity of A was 3x = 3*5 = 15 liters.",A

Math,"81 , 64 , 27 , 16 . . . The options are: a ) 12 , b ) 4 , c ) 9 , d ) 3 , e ) 1",c,e,False,"step 1: Observe the given sequence: 81, 64, 27, 16, ....
step 2: Notice that these numbers are all perfect cubes or squares: 81 (9^2), 64 (8^2 or 4^3), 27 (3^3), 16 (4^2).
step 3: Identify the pattern in the sequence. The sequence alternates between squares and cubes: square (9^2), cube (4^3), cube (3^3), square (4^2).
step 4: Recognize that the sequence is decreasing and alternates between the square of a number and the cube of a smaller number.
step 5: Predict the next term in the sequence. Since the last number given is 16 (4^2), the next number should be a cube.
step 6: Determine the next smaller cube after 27 (3^3), which is 8 (2^3).
step 7: Realize that step 6 was incorrect in predicting the pattern, as the sequence actually follows a pattern of decreasing perfect squares and cubes without repeating the base number. The correct next step is to find the square or cube smaller than 16 (4^2) that follows the pattern.
step 8: Since the pattern involves decreasing numbers and the last number is a square, the next number should be a cube smaller than 16. The cube smaller than 16 is 8 (2^3), but it does not fit the alternating pattern correctly. The correct observation is that after 16 (4^2), we should look for a square smaller than 16, which is 9 (3^2), but 9 does not fit as it breaks the sequence of unique bases. The correct approach is to recognize the mistake in the pattern analysis and correctly identify that after 16, the sequence should logically continue with a smaller number that fits the observed pattern of squares and cubes. The correct next term, following the corrected understanding of the pattern, is actually 1 (1^1 or 1^2 or 1^3), as it is the next perfect power (square or cube) that follows the descending order.
step 9: Correct the analysis to conclude that the next number in the sequence, following the corrected pattern of descending perfect powers, is 1.",c

Math,"2 ^ 46655 mod 9 = ? The options are: a ) 4 , b ) 5 , c ) 6 , d ) 7 , e ) 8",b,e,False,"step 1: Recognize that the problem asks for the remainder when 2^46655 is divided by 9.
step 2: Recall Euler's theorem, which states that for any integer a coprime with n, a^φ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n), where φ(n) is Euler's totient function. However, since 2 and 9 are not coprime (they share a common factor, which is 1), we cannot directly apply Euler's theorem.
step 3: Notice that we can simplify the problem by finding a pattern in the powers of 2 modulo 9. Start by calculating the first few powers of 2 mod 9: 2^1 mod 9 = 2, 2^2 mod 9 = 4, 2^3 mod 9 = 8, 2^4 mod 9 = 7, 2^5 mod 9 = 5, 2^6 mod 9 = 1, and then it repeats.
step 4: Observe that the powers of 2 modulo 9 cycle every 6 steps: 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1.
step 5: Since the cycle repeats every 6 steps, we can find the remainder of 46655 divided by 6 to determine where in the cycle 2^46655 falls. 46655 mod 6 = 3.
step 6: According to our cycle, the third number in the sequence is 8. Therefore, 2^46655 mod 9 = 8.",e

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 cubic foot is 12*12*12 = 1728 cubic inches. Therefore, 30 cubic feet is 30*1728 cubic inches.
step 2: Calculate the total volume of the tank in cubic inches. 30*1728 = 51840 cubic inches.
step 3: Calculate the net rate of water flowing out of the tank. The inlet pipe adds water at a rate of 3 cubic inches/min, and the two outlet pipes remove water at rates of 12 cubic inches/min and 6 cubic inches/min respectively.
step 4: The net rate of water flowing out = (Rate of outlet 1 + Rate of outlet 2) - Rate of inlet = (12 + 6) - 3 = 15 cubic inches/min.
step 5: Calculate the time it takes to empty the tank. Time = Volume / Rate = 51840 cubic inches / 15 cubic inches/min.

The options are: a ) 30 , b ) 40 , c ) 50 , d ) 60 , e ) 70",e,e,False,"step 1: Let the original cost price of the article be 'x'.
step 2: The man sells the article at a profit of 25%, so the selling price is x + 25% of x = 1.25x.
step 3: If he had bought it at 20% less, the new cost price would be x - 20% of x = 0.8x.
step 4: He would have sold it for Rs. 14.70 less, so the new selling price is 1.25x - 14.70.
step 5: At this new selling price, he would have gained 30%, so the new selling price is 0.8x + 30% of 0.8x = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 6: Equate the two expressions for the new selling price: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.3 * 0.8x.
step 7: Simplify the equation: 1.25x - 14.70 = 1.04x.

Math,"on rainy mornings , mo drinks exactly n cups of hot chocolate ( assume that n is an integer ) . on mornings that are not rainy , mo drinks exactly 5 cups of tea . last week mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together . if during that week mo drank 8 more tea cups than hot chocolate cups , then how many rainy days were there last week ? The options are: a ) 2 , b ) 4 , c ) 3 , d ) 5 , e ) 6",b,b,False,"step 1: Let's denote the number of rainy days as 'r' and the number of non-rainy days as 'nr'.
step 2: Since Mo drinks n cups of hot chocolate on rainy days, the total cups of hot chocolate drunk in a week is 'n*r'.
step 3: On non-rainy days, Mo drinks exactly 5 cups of tea, so the total cups of tea drunk in a week is '5*nr'.
step 4: We are given that Mo drank a total of 22 cups of tea and hot chocolate together, which gives us the equation: n*r + 5*nr = 22.
step 5: We are also given that Mo drank 8 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, which gives us the equation: 5*nr = n*r + 8.
step 6: Since there are 7 days in a week, we have another equation: r + nr = 7.
step 7: From step 5, we can simplify to nr = r + 8/5, but since nr and r must be integers, this equation seems incorrect in the context. Correcting the interpretation: the correct equation from the given information is 5*nr - n*r = 8.
step 8: Substituting nr = 7 - r into the equation from step 7 gives us 5*(7 - r) - n*r = 8. However, realizing the mistake in step 7, we should directly use the information to solve the problem without misinterpreting the equations.
step 9: Correct approach: Let's use the information directly. Total drinks = 22, and tea cups are 8 more than hot chocolate cups. If we let 't' be the number of tea cups and 'h' be the number of hot chocolate cups, we have t + h = 22 and t = h + 8. Solving these equations gives us t = 15 and h = 7. Since Mo drinks 5 cups of tea on non-rainy days, nr = 15/5 = 3. Therefore, r = 7 - 3 = 4 rainy days.
step 10: Correcting the mistake in step 7 and following the correct approach in step 9 leads us to the correct number of rainy days.",c

Math,"a man whose speed is 7 kmph in still water rows to a certain upstream point and back to the starting point in a river which flows at 1.5 kmph , find his average speed for the total journey ? The options are: a ) 6.7 , b ) 4 , c ) 6 , d ) 9 , e ) 3",a,a,False,"step 1: Identify the speed of the man in still water, which is 7 kmph.
step 2: Identify the speed of the river, which is 1.5 kmph.
step 3: Calculate the effective speed of the man upstream, which is the speed in still water minus the speed of the river, i.e., 7 - 1.5 = 5.5 kmph.
step 4: Calculate the effective speed of the man downstream, which is the speed in still water plus the speed of the river, i.e., 7 + 1.5 = 8.5 kmph.
step 5: Assume the distance to the certain point and back is 'D' km each way, so the total distance for the round trip is 2D km.
step 6: Calculate the time taken to travel upstream, which is Distance/Speed = D/5.5 hours.
step 7: Calculate the time taken to travel downstream, which is Distance/Speed = D/8.5 hours.
step 8: Calculate the total time for the journey, which is the sum of the time taken upstream and downstream = D/5.5 + D/8.5 hours.
step 9: Calculate the average speed for the total journey, which is Total Distance / Total Time = 2D / (D/5.5 + D/8.5).
step 10: Simplify the expression for average speed and solve for the value, which gives 2D / (D*(1/5.5 + 1/8.5)) = 2 / (1/5.5 + 1/8.5) = 2 / ((8.5 + 5.5) / (5.5*8.5)) = 2 / (14 / 46.75) = 2 * (46.75 / 14) = 93.5 / 14 = 6.67857142857 kmph.",c

Since the tomato juice is 90% water, it means 10% of it is solid content.
step 2: Calculate the amount of solid content in 80 liters of tomato juice. Since 10% of it is solid, 80 liters * 10% = 8 liters of solid content.
step 3: Understand that the process of boiling tomato juice into puree only removes water, so the amount of solid content remains the same.
step 4: Since the tomato puree has 20% water, it means 80% of it is solid content.
step 5: Set up an equation to find out how many liters of tomato puree will contain 8 liters of solid content, knowing that this solid content represents 80% of the total puree volume. Let x be the total volume of the puree. Therefore, 80% of x = 8 liters.

step 2: Recognize that for a 50 Hz supply, one cycle consists of two half cycles. 
step 3: Realize that the question asks for the one cycle surge current, which might imply the total current the SCR can handle over a full cycle, or it might be interpreted as the peak current for a full cycle. 
step 4: Understand that the surge current rating given (3000 A) is for a half cycle, and this value does not double for a full cycle since the rating is about the peak current it can handle at any instant, not a cumulative value over time. 
step 5: Conclude that the one cycle surge current rating would remain the same as the half cycle surge current rating because it represents the peak current the SCR can handle, which does not change whether considering a half cycle or a full cycle. 
step 6: Therefore, the correct answer is not about adding or averaging the half cycle ratings but understanding the nature of the rating itself.","The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding. Without additional information or a clear understanding of how surge current ratings scale with cycle duration, none of the provided options can be directly derived from the given data."

It often emphasizes the perspectives and experiences of the colonized or formerly colonized peoples.
step 2: Evaluate option A, which states that postcolonialism considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies. This aligns with postcolonialism's focus on non-Western perspectives and the importance of local and indigenous contexts, making it a feature of postcolonialism rather than a distinction from other perspectives.
step 3: Consider option B, which mentions postcolonialism's attention to 'small wars' and asymmetric conflicts. This is consistent with postcolonialism's broader view of security that goes beyond traditional state-centric and major war focuses, thus it is a defining feature of postcolonialism.
step 4: Look at option C, which highlights postcolonialism's focus on the role of violence in world politics. While postcolonialism does critically examine violence, including colonial violence, this focus is not unique to postcolonialism as other theories, such as realism and critical security studies, also consider the role of violence in world politics.
step 5: Review option D, which asserts that postcolonialism is not a predominantly or exclusively European form of knowledge. This is a key aspect of postcolonialism, as it seeks to decenter Eurocentric views and incorporate perspectives from the Global South and other marginalized voices, making it a defining feature.
