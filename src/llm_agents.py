#
#         2. Faithfulness: This type of error refers to the divergence of my step analysis from the original question or
#         previous steps, as well as self-consistency within my steps. In mathematics for instance, it may represents that
#         I understood the question wrongly or my proposed step is inconsistent with my previous step.
#
#         Based on my current step response, question, previous steps, and my error definitions, help me verify if any of
#         the mistakes (factuality or faithfulness) occur on my analysis. Notice that skipping step should not be considered
#         as error as long as the calculation is correct! For instance, 2x+2 should be the same as 2+2x. Also
#         2x+2+3 should be the same as 2x+5
#
#
#         At step 1, since we have no step 0, instead the factuality and faithfulness check
#          should reflect if I correctly understood the answer.
#
#          Do not detect any minor hallucinations! In other words, only targeting the mistakes that contain calculation error
#          or apparent logical flaw or contradict real-world facts! If the provided step acknowledge mistake, you need to
#          capture it and correct it.
#
#          If you see any step ended up with '*<verified>*' it means it have been checked without any mistake, so just consider
#          it as correct and do not have to give the verification. Simply say step hallu is [NO]!!!
