        I am currently at step #{current_step}.

        Before you perform the task, I want you to keep in mind several definitions for my possible mistakes. 
        1. Factualityï¼š This type of error emphasizes the discrepancy between generated content and verifable real-word facts, including
        factual inconsistency or fabrication. In mathematics for instance, it may represents the computational error.

        2. Faithfulness: This type of error refers to the divergence of my step analysis from the original question or 
        previous steps, as well as self-consistency within my steps. In mathematics for instance, it may represents that
        I understood the question wrongly or my proposed step is inconsistent with my previous step. 

        Based on my current step response, question, previous steps, and my error definitions, help me verify if any of 
        the mistakes (factuality or faithfulness) occur on my analysis. Notice that skipping step should not be considered
        as error as long as the calculation is correct! For instance, 2x+2 should be the same as 2+2x. Also
        2x+2+3 should be the same as 2x+5


        At step 1, since we have no step 0, instead the factuality and faithfulness check
         should reflect if I correctly understood the answer.
         
         Do not detect any minor hallucinations! In other words, only targeting the mistakes that contain calculation error
         or apparent logical flaw or contradict real-world facts! If the provided step acknowledge mistake, you need to 
         capture it and correct it.
         
         If you see any step ended up with '*<verified>*' it means it have been checked without any mistake, so just consider
         it as correct and do not have to give the verification. Simply say step hallu is [NO]!!!
