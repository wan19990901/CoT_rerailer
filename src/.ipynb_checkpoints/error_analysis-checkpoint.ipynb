      "Step 2: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to corn syrup in the sport formulation, which is three times the standard, making it 3:12 or simplified to 1:4.\n",
      "Step 3: Determine the new ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation, which is half the standard, making it 1:15.\n",
      "Step 4: Combine the ratios for the sport formulation to get the overall ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water, which is 1:4:15.\n",
      "Step 5: Given that the sport formulation contains 3 ounces of corn syrup, and the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:4, calculate the amount of flavoring. Since for every 4 parts of corn syrup there is 1 part of flavoring, there are 3/4 ounces of flavoring.\n",
      "Step 6: Use the ratio of flavoring to water (1:15) to calculate the amount of water. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 15 parts of water.\n",
      "Step 7: Since there are 3/4 ounces of flavoring, multiply this by 15 to find the amount of water. (3/4) * 15 = 45/4 = 11.25 ounces of water.\n",
      "Step 8: Realize there was a mistake in Step 7 calculation regarding the amount of water. The correct approach is to recognize that the ratios should be applied proportionally across all components.\n",
      "Step 9: Since the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is 1:4, and there are 3 ounces of corn syrup, the total parts of flavoring and corn syrup together account for 5 parts (1 part flavoring + 4 parts corn syrup).\n",
      "Step 10: Given the total parts of the mixture based on the ratio 1:4:15, the total parts are 20 (1 part flavoring + 4 parts corn syrup + 15 parts water).\n",
      "Step 11: Since 5 parts (flavoring + corn syrup) correspond to 3 ounces, then 20 parts (the whole mixture) will correspond to (3 ounces / 5 parts) * 20 parts = 12 ounces. Therefore, the water part, which is 15 parts, will be (15/20) * 12 ounces = 9 ounces.\n",
      "Step 12: Correct the mistake in Step 11, realizing the calculation error. The correct calculation should directly use the ratio to find the amount of water. Since there are 3 ounces of corn syrup (4 parts), and the ratio of corn syrup to water is 4:15, for every 4 ounces of corn syrup, there should be 15 ounces of water. Therefore, if 3 ounces of corn syrup are present, the amount of water should be (15/4) * 3 = 11.25 ounces, indicating a calculation error in the process.\n",
      "Final Answer\n",
      "There seems to be a mistake in my calculations. None of the options match the corrected calculation. Please disregard the incorrect steps and calculations.\n",
